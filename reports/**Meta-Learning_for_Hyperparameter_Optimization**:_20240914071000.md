# Experiment Report: **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**:

## Idea
**Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implement a meta-learning approach to optimize hyperparameters of machine learning models with minimal computational overhead. Utilize a small, auxiliary neural network trained on a diverse set of tasks to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks, reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter search and fine-tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning approach to optimize hyperparameters of machine learning models. The primary goal is to minimize computational overhead while maintaining or improving model performance. We aim to utilize a small auxiliary neural network trained on a diverse set of tasks to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks, thereby reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter search and fine-tuning.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Task Collection**: Gather a diverse set of tasks with varying data distributions and models.
2. **Meta-Training Data Preparation**: For each task, perform a comprehensive hyperparameter search (e.g., grid search or random search) to find near-optimal hyperparameters and record the performance.
3. **Auxiliary Network Training**: Train a small auxiliary neural network on the collected meta-training data. The input features will be task-specific characteristics, and the output will be the predicted optimal hyperparameters.
4. **Meta-Testing**: For new, unseen tasks, use the auxiliary network to predict hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance.
5. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance and computational overhead of the meta-learning approach against traditional hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

#### 3. Datasets
The datasets will be sourced from Hugging Face Datasets and will encompass a variety of tasks to ensure diversity:
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10, MNIST
- **Text Classification**: AG News, IMDb
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Yelp Reviews, SST-2
- **Regression**: Boston Housing, Diabetes

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Auxiliary Neural Network**: 
  - Input Layer: Task-specific features (e.g., dataset statistics, model architecture details)
  - Hidden Layers: 2 layers with 64 and 32 neurons respectively, ReLU activation
  - Output Layer: Predicted hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size)
- **Primary Models for Each Task**:
  - Image Classification: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis: Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)
  - Regression: Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be optimized by the auxiliary network:
- **Learning Rate**: Continuous value between 1e-5 and 1e-1
- **Batch Size**: Discrete values {16, 32, 64, 128}
- **Number of Layers**: Discrete values {2, 3, 4}
- **Number of Neurons per Layer**: Discrete values {32, 64, 128}
- **Dropout Rate**: Continuous value between 0 and 0.5

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the meta-learning approach will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Model Performance**: Accuracy for classification tasks, Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.
- **Computational Overhead**: Time taken and computational resources used (e.g., number of GPU hours).
- **Hyperparameter Quality**: Comparison of model performance with predicted hyperparameters versus traditional hyperparameter search methods.
- **Generalization**: The ability of the auxiliary network to predict optimal hyperparameters for unseen tasks.

The results will be aggregated and analyzed to determine the efficacy of the meta-learning approach in reducing computational overhead while maintaining or improving model performance.
