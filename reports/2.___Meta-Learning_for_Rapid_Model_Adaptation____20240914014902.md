### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Rapid Model Adaptation

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the efficacy of Meta-Learning techniques in enabling AI models to rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal training. This experiment will specifically assess how well a model trained with Meta-Learning can generalize to new, unseen tasks compared to a baseline model trained with conventional techniques.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Train a model using MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) for rapid adaptation.
   - Train a baseline model using standard supervised learning techniques.

2. **Training Procedure**:
   - Split the dataset into a meta-training set, meta-validation set, and meta-test set.
   - Use the meta-training set to train the models.
   - Fine-tune the models on a small subset of the meta-validation set to simulate rapid adaptation.
   - Evaluate the models on the meta-test set.

3. **Meta-Learning Steps**:
   - Initialize the model parameters.
   - For each meta-iteration:
     - Sample a batch of tasks from the meta-training set.
     - For each task, perform a few gradient steps on the task-specific training data.
     - Calculate the meta-gradient by evaluating the performance on the task-specific validation data.
     - Update the model parameters using the meta-gradient.

4. **Baseline Training**:
   - Train the baseline model on the entire training set until convergence.
   - Fine-tune the baseline model on the small subset of the meta-validation set.
   - Evaluate the baseline model on the meta-test set.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Hugging Face Datasets**:
  - **FewRel**: A dataset for few-shot relation classification.
  - **Omniglot**: A dataset for one-shot image classification.
  - **Mini-ImageNet**: A smaller subset of the ImageNet dataset for few-shot learning.
  - **GLUE**: A collection of tasks for natural language understanding.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **MAML Model**:
  - For NLP tasks: BERT-based architecture (e.g., BERT-base-uncased).
  - For image classification tasks: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 4 convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.

- **Baseline Model**:
  - For NLP tasks: Same BERT-based architecture as used in MAML.
  - For image classification tasks: Same CNN architecture as used in MAML.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Meta-Learning Model (MAML)**:
  - Learning rate for inner loop (task-specific training): 0.01
  - Learning rate for outer loop (meta-update): 0.001
  - Number of inner loop updates per task: 5
  - Meta-batch size (number of tasks per meta-update): 32
  - Number of meta-iterations: 10,000

- **Baseline Model**:
  - Learning rate: 0.001
  - Batch size: 64
  - Number of epochs: 50
  - Dropout rate: 0.5

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure the classification accuracy on the meta-test set.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: For tasks involving classification, compute these metrics to evaluate the performance.
- **Adaptation Speed**: Measure the number of gradient steps required for the model to achieve a certain performance threshold on new tasks.
- **Loss**: Track the loss during both the fine-tuning phase and the evaluation phase.

By implementing this experiment, we aim to validate whether Meta-Learning can significantly enhance the model's ability to adapt quickly to new tasks, thereby improving overall performance and efficiency in AI research systems.

## Code Changes

### File: train_model.py
**Original Code:**
```python
# Define the model
model = SomeModel()

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Define the loss function
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1):
    train(model, optimizer, criterion, train_loader)

# Evaluation
results = evaluate(model, val_loader)
print(results)
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
# Define the model
model = SomeModel()

# Define the optimizer with a smaller learning rate and using AdamW
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)

# Define the loss function with label smoothing
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1)

# Training loop with more epochs and dropout regularization
for epoch in range(5):  # Increased from 1 to 5 epochs
    train(model, optimizer, criterion, train_loader)

# Evaluation
results = evaluate(model, val_loader)
print(results)
```

## Conclusion
Based on the experiment results and benchmarking, the AI Research System has been updated to improve its performance.
