# Experiment Report: **Efficient Model Pruning Based on Real-Time Usage

## Idea
**Efficient Model Pruning Based on Real-Time Usage Patterns**: Develop a lightweight algorithm that dynamically prunes neural networks based on real-time usage patterns and input data characteristics. This method could identify and remove redundant neurons during inference, leading to faster and more efficient models without significant loss in accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Model Pruning Based on Real-Time Usage Patterns

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a lightweight algorithm that dynamically prunes neural networks during inference based on real-time usage patterns and input data characteristics. The goal is to achieve faster and more efficient models without significant loss in accuracy.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**: 
   - Develop an algorithm that monitors neuron activations during inference.
   - Identify and record neurons that consistently show low activation across multiple inputs.
   - Prune these low-activation neurons dynamically in real-time to reduce computational load.

2. **Integration with Model**:
   - Integrate the pruning algorithm with a pre-trained model.
   - Implement a mechanism to reintroduce pruned neurons if they become relevant for new input patterns.

3. **Training Phase**:
   - Train several baseline models on the selected datasets without pruning.
   - Record baseline performance metrics (accuracy, inference time, computational resource usage).

4. **Inference Phase with Pruning**:
   - Apply the pruning algorithm during the inference phase of the trained models.
   - Compare performance metrics with and without pruning.

5. **Analysis**:
   - Analyze the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model accuracy.
   - Compare the pruned model's performance to the baseline.

  - Max Pooling Layers
  - Fully Connected Layers
  - Output Layer
  
- **Bidirectional LSTM** for IMDB Reviews:
  - Embedding Layer
  - BiLSTM Layers
  - Fully Connected Layers
  - Output Layer

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: `0.001`
- **Batch Size**: `64`
- **Epochs**: `20`
- **Pruning Threshold**: `0.05` (threshold for neuron activation below which neurons are pruned)
- **Reactivation Threshold**: `0.10` (threshold for reactivating pruned neurons if they become relevant)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure the classification accuracy before and after pruning.
- **Inference Time**: Measure the time taken for inference per sample before and after pruning.
- **Computational Resource Usage**: Measure the CPU/GPU utilization before and after pruning.
- **Model Size**: Measure the size of the model (in terms of parameters) before and after pruning.
- **F1 Score**: Evaluate the precision and recall trade-offs before and after pruning.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to validate whether dynamic pruning based on real-time usage patterns can significantly improve the efficiency of AI models without compromising their performance.
