# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develo

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the model's performance during training. The algorithm would monitor metrics like loss and gradient magnitudes to fine-tune the learning rate in real-time, aiming to improve convergence speed and final accuracy without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on model performance metrics such as loss and gradient magnitudes during training. The goal is to improve the convergence speed and final accuracy of the model without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. Methodology

#### Development of the Adaptive Learning Rate Algorithm
1. **Initialization**: Start with a base learning rate.
2. **Monitoring**: During each training epoch, monitor the following:
   - Loss
   - Gradient magnitudes
3. **Adjustment**: Dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the monitored metrics. For instance:
   - If the loss plateaus or increases, reduce the learning rate.
   - If the gradient magnitudes are too small, indicating slow learning, increase the learning rate.
4. **Implementation**: Implement this adaptive learning rate algorithm within a popular deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

#### Experimental Setup
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Train models using conventional learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, exponential decay) as baselines.
2. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Train models using the newly developed adaptive learning rate algorithm.
3. **Reproducibility**: Ensure reproducibility by running multiple trials for each setup and averaging the results.

### 3. Datasets
The following datasets will be used to evaluate the performance of the adaptive learning rate algorithm:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (dataset name: `cifar10`)
2. **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
   - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (dataset name: `imdb`)
3. **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits in 10 classes.
   - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (dataset name: `mnist`)

### 4. Model Architecture
The following model architectures will be used for the experiments:
1. **CIFAR-10**: ResNet-18, a residual neural network with 18 layers.
2. **IMDB Reviews**: BERT (`bert-base-uncased`), a transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of English text.
3. **MNIST**: A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with two convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers.

### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be used for the initial setup and baseline experiments:
1. **CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18)**:
   - Base Learning Rate: 0.1
   - Batch Size: 128
   - Epochs: 100
   - Optimizer: SGD with Momentum (momentum=0.9)
2. **IMDB Reviews (BERT)**:
   - Base Learning Rate: 2e-5
   - Batch Size: 32
   - Epochs: 3
   - Optimizer: AdamW
3. **MNIST (CNN)**:
   - Base Learning Rate: 0.01
   - Batch Size: 64
   - Epochs: 20
   - Optimizer: Adam

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following evaluation metrics will be used to compare the performance of the adaptive learning rate algorithm against the baseline methods:
1. **Convergence Speed**: Measured by the number of epochs required to reach a predefined loss threshold.
2. **Final Accuracy**: The model accuracy on the test set after training is complete.
3. **Loss**: The final loss value on the test set after training.
4. **Training Stability**: Variability in the training loss over epochs, indicating the stability of the training process.
5. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The robustness of the learning rate schedule to different initial learning rates.

By comparing these metrics, we aim to determine whether the adaptive learning rate algorithm provides tangible benefits over conventional learning rate schedules in terms of speed, accuracy, and ease of use.
