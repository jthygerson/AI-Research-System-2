# Experiment Report: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically

## Idea
Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of an AI model based on real-time feedback from the training process. This could help in achieving faster convergence and better performance with limited computational resources.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan to Test Meta-Learning Algorithm for Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment

### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of an AI model based on real-time feedback from the training process. We aim to determine whether this approach can achieve faster convergence and better performance with limited computational resources compared to static learning rate schedules.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Meta-Learning Algorithm Development**:
   - Develop a meta-learning algorithm that can adjust the learning rate dynamically. This algorithm will use real-time feedback such as gradient magnitudes, loss values, and validation accuracy to modify the learning rate.
   - Implement this meta-learning algorithm as a wrapper around the optimizer in a standard training loop.

2. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Train the same AI model using traditional static learning rate schedules like step decay, exponential decay, and cyclic learning rates for comparison.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train the models (one with the meta-learning algorithm and others with static schedules) on the training set.
   - Validate the models on the validation set to adjust hyperparameters and learning rates.
   - Evaluate the final performance on the test set.

4. **Reproducibility**:
   - Ensure that the experiments are reproducible by fixing random seeds and using consistent data splits.

### 3. Datasets
We will use well-known datasets from the Hugging Face Datasets repository to ensure the experiment's generalizability across different data types. The chosen datasets are:
   - **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`cifar10`)
   - **Text Classification**: IMDb Reviews (`imdb`)
   - **Tabular Data**: Titanic Survival Prediction (`titanic`)

### 4. Model Architecture
We will use different model architectures suitable for each type of dataset:
   - **Image Classification**: ResNet-18
   - **Text Classification**: BERT (Base, uncased)
   - **Tabular Data**: XGBoost

### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be used in the experiments:
   - **Learning Rate (Initial)**: `0.001`
   - **Batch Size**: `32`
   - **Epochs**: `50`
   - **Optimizer**: Adam
   - **Meta-Learning Parameters**:
     - Feedback Interval: `1 batch`
     - Learning Rate Adjustment Factor: `0.1`
     - Gradient Magnitude Threshold: `0.01`
   - **Static Learning Rate Schedules**:
     - Step Decay Steps: `10`
     - Step Decay Factor: `0.1`
     - Exponential Decay Rate: `0.96`
     - Cyclic Learning Rate Base LR: `0.0001`
     - Cyclic Learning Rate Max LR: `0.01`

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
We will evaluate the models using the following metrics:
   - **Training Time**: Total time taken for training until convergence.
   - **Number of Epochs to Convergence**: Number of epochs required to reach a stable validation loss.
   - **Validation Accuracy**: Accuracy on the validation set.
   - **Test Accuracy**: Accuracy on the test set.
   - **Loss Reduction Rate**: Rate at which the loss decreases during training.
   - **Resource Utilization**: Computational resources used (e.g., GPU hours).

By comparing these metrics for the meta-learning algorithm and the static learning rate schedules, we aim to determine the efficacy of dynamic learning rate adjustment in improving model performance and resource efficiency.
