# Experiment Report: 4. **Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Lear

## Idea
4. **Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning**: Implement a meta-learning approach to hyperparameter tuning that leverages past training experiences to quickly converge on optimal hyperparameters for new tasks. This method should reduce the number of required training runs, making it feasible to tune models within a limited computational budget.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning approach for hyperparameter tuning in reducing the computational resources and time needed to find optimal hyperparameters for new machine learning tasks. The hypothesis is that by leveraging past training experiences, the system can efficiently converge on optimal hyperparameters, thereby minimizing the number of required training runs.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Meta-Learning Setup:**
   - Collect hyperparameter optimization data from a series of prior tasks.
   - Implement a meta-learning model that learns from this historical data to predict good hyperparameter settings for new tasks.

2. **Training Phase:**
   - Use Bayesian Optimization as a baseline for hyperparameter tuning.
   - Implement the meta-learning approach using a recurrent neural network (RNN) that takes in task-specific features and outputs predicted optimal hyperparameters.

3. **Evaluation Phase:**
   - Compare the performance of the meta-learning approach against the baseline Bayesian Optimization.
   - Measure the number of training runs required to achieve performance within 95% of the best-known performance for each task.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10:** A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **MNIST:** A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples.
- **IMDB:** A dataset for binary sentiment classification with 50,000 movie reviews.
- **AG News:** A dataset of news articles categorized into four classes (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech).

These datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification Tasks (CIFAR-10, MNIST):**
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers: Convolution, ReLU, MaxPooling, Fully Connected, Softmax.
- **Text Classification Tasks (IMDB, AG News):**
  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM units, followed by Fully Connected and Softmax layers.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate:** Initial value from a range (0.0001 to 0.1)
- **Batch Size:** Options (16, 32, 64, 128)
- **Number of Epochs:** Options (10, 20, 30, 50)
- **Optimizer:** Options (SGD, Adam)
- **Dropout Rate:** Options (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5)
- **CNN-Specific:**
  - Number of Filters: Options (32, 64, 128)
  - Filter Size: Options (3x3, 5x5)
- **RNN-Specific:**
  - Number of LSTM Units: Options (50, 100, 150)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Training Time:** Time taken to train the model until convergence.
- **Number of Training Runs:** Total number of training runs required to achieve within 95% of the best-known performance.
- **Computational Cost:** Total computational resources (in GPU hours) used.

By comparing these metrics across the meta-learning approach and the baseline Bayesian Optimization, we can evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.
