# Experiment Report: Create an adaptive data augmentation algorithm tha

## Idea
Create an adaptive data augmentation algorithm that learns the most effective augmentation techniques for a given dataset in real-time. This method would optimize the training process by dynamically adjusting augmentation parameters to improve model robustness and generalization.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive data augmentation algorithm that dynamically learns and applies the most effective augmentation techniques for a given dataset in real-time. The goal is to optimize the training process by adjusting augmentation parameters to improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

### 2. Methodology

#### Step 1: Initial Setup
1. **Data Preparation**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Baseline Model Training**: Train a baseline model on the dataset without any data augmentation to establish a performance benchmark.

#### Step 2: Adaptive Data Augmentation Algorithm
1. **Initialization**: Start with a set of common data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping, color jitter).
2. **Exploration**: Randomly apply different combinations and intensities of augmentation techniques to the training data during initial epochs.
3. **Evaluation**: Monitor the model's performance on the validation set after each epoch.
4. **Optimization**: Utilize a reinforcement learning approach (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) to adjust augmentation parameters based on performance feedback.
5. **Convergence**: Continue the process until the model's performance on the validation set stabilizes or improves significantly.

#### Step 3: Comparison and Analysis
1. **Final Training**: Train the model using the optimized augmentation parameters.
2. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the model trained with adaptive augmentation against the baseline model and a model trained with standard, non-adaptive augmentation techniques.

### 3. Datasets

We will use the following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.

### 4. Model Architecture

For image classification (CIFAR-10):
- **Model**: ResNet-18

For text classification (IMDB):
- **Model**: BERT-base-uncased

### 5. Hyperparameters

For ResNet-18:
- **Learning Rate**: 0.01
- **Batch Size**: 128
- **Epochs**: 100
- **Optimizer**: SGD with Momentum (momentum=0.9)

For BERT-base-uncased:
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-5
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 3
- **Optimizer**: AdamW

For Adaptive Augmentation Algorithm:
- **Initial Exploration Rate**: 0.3
- **Exploration Decay Rate**: 0.99 per epoch
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Learning Rate for PPO**: 0.001

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

For both image and text classification tasks, we will use the following evaluation metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Validation Loss**: The loss on the validation set, used to monitor overfitting.

### Execution Plan

1. **Baseline Training**: Train and evaluate the baseline models on CIFAR-10 and IMDB without data augmentation.
2. **Adaptive Augmentation Training**: Implement the adaptive augmentation algorithm and train the models on CIFAR-10 and IMDB.
3. **Standard Augmentation Training**: Train the models on CIFAR-10 and IMDB with standard, non-adaptive augmentation techniques for comparison.
4. **Performance Comparison**: Analyze and compare the results using the specified evaluation metrics.

By following this detailed experiment plan, we aim to validate the effectiveness of the adaptive data augmentation algorithm in improving model robustness and generalization across different types of datasets and model architectures.

# Updated Code:
def augment_data(dataset):
    # Implement your data augmentation strategies here
    # For illustration, let's assume we are doubling the data with some augmentation
    augmented_data = []
    for data in dataset:
        augmented_data.append(data)  # Original data
        augmented_data.append(augment(data))  # Augmented data
    return augmented_data

train_dataset = load_dataset('dataset_name', split='train')
train_dataset = augment_data(train_dataset)
```
