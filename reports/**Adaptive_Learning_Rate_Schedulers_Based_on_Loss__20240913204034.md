# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Loss 

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Loss Landscape Analysis**: Design an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time analysis of the loss landscape. This scheduler would aim to improve convergence speed and model performance by identifying and reacting to changes in the gradient distribution and loss curvature during training, optimizing the learning rate accordingly.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time analysis of the loss landscape during training. The hypothesis is that such an adaptive scheduler will improve convergence speed and overall model performance compared to traditional static or heuristic-based learning rate schedules.

### 2. Methodology

1. **Design the Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler**: 
   - Implement a learning rate scheduler that adjusts learning rates based on real-time analysis of the loss landscape, including gradient distribution and loss curvature.
   - Use second-order information (e.g., Hessian) or approximations (e.g., gradient norms) to gauge the curvature and adjust learning rates dynamically.

2. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Compare the adaptive scheduler against common learning rate schedules such as constant learning rate, step decay, and cosine annealing.

3. **Training Protocol**:
   - Train identical neural network architectures on identical datasets using different learning rate schedules.
   - Ensure all other hyperparameters remain constant across experiments to isolate the effect of the learning rate scheduler.

4. **Loss Landscape Analysis**:
   - During training, periodically analyze the gradient distribution and loss curvature.
   - Adjust the learning rate accordingly and log the adjustments for later analysis.

### 3. Datasets

The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used to ensure a comprehensive evaluation across different data types and tasks:

1. **Image Classification**: 
   - CIFAR-10 (`cifar10`)
   - MNIST (`mnist`)

2. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - IMDB Reviews (`imdb`)
   - SST-2 (`sst2`)

3. **Tabular Data**:
   - UCI Adult Dataset (`adult`)

### 4. Model Architecture

For each dataset, the following model architectures will be used:

1. **Image Classification**:
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 and MNIST.

2. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for IMDB Reviews and SST-2.

3. **Tabular Data**:
   - Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) for the UCI Adult Dataset.

### 5. Hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters will be used and held constant across all experiments to isolate the effect of the learning rate scheduler:

- **Batch Size**: 
  - `64` for CIFAR-10 and MNIST
  - `32` for IMDB Reviews and SST-2
  - `128` for UCI Adult Dataset

- **Initial Learning Rate**: 
  - `0.001` for all datasets and models

- **Optimizer**:
  - `Adam` for all datasets and models

- **Epochs**: 
  - `50` for CIFAR-10 and MNIST
  - `20` for IMDB Reviews and SST-2
  - `30` for UCI Adult Dataset

- **Weight Decay**: `0.0005`

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the adaptive learning rate scheduler, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Convergence Speed**:
   - Number of epochs to reach a predefined validation loss threshold.
   - Total training time to reach the threshold.

2. **Model Performance**:
   - Final validation accuracy for classification tasks (CIFAR-10, MNIST, IMDB, SST-2).
   - Final validation F1 score for classification tasks (IMDB, SST-2).
   - Final validation AUC-ROC for the tabular dataset (UCI Adult Dataset).

3. **Stability**:
   - Variance in training loss and validation loss over epochs.
   - Frequency and magnitude of learning rate adjustments.

4. **Loss Landscape Metrics**:
   - Gradient norms over epochs.
   - Curvature (Hessian eigenvalues or approximations) over epochs.

### Execution

1. **Implementation**: Implement the adaptive learning rate scheduler within a popular deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
2. **Training**: Train models with both the adaptive scheduler and baseline schedulers on each dataset.
3. **Logging**: Record all relevant metrics, learning rate adjustments, and loss landscape analyses.
4. **Analysis**: Compare convergence speeds, model performance, and stability metrics across different schedulers.
5. **Reporting**: Summarize findings in a comprehensive report, highlighting the advantages and potential drawbacks of the adaptive learning rate scheduler.

By following this experimental plan, the effectiveness of the adaptive learning rate scheduler can be rigorously evaluated against traditional methods, providing insights into its potential benefits and applications in various AI/ML tasks.
