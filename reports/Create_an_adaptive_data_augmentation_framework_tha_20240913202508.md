# Experiment Report: Create an adaptive data augmentation framework tha

## Idea
Create an adaptive data augmentation framework that selectively applies augmentation techniques based on the current performance and learning phase of the model. The framework should be designed to improve generalization and robustness, especially in low-resource training environments.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate an adaptive data augmentation framework that selectively applies augmentation techniques based on the current performance and learning phase of the model. This framework aims to improve the model's generalization and robustness, particularly in low-resource training environments.

### 2. Methodology

#### 2.1 Adaptive Data Augmentation Framework
- **Phase 1: Initial Training** 
  - Apply standard data augmentation techniques uniformly.
  - Monitor model performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).
  
- **Phase 2: Performance-Based Adjustment**
  - Analyze the performance metrics to determine the learning phase (e.g., underfitting, optimal, overfitting).
  - Selectively apply augmentation techniques:
    - **Underfitting Phase:** Increase augmentation intensity (e.g., stronger transformations, higher probability).
    - **Optimal Phase:** Maintain current augmentation settings.
    - **Overfitting Phase:** Introduce more diverse augmentations or reduce the intensity to avoid memorization.

#### 2.2 Experiment Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardize and normalize datasets.
2. **Initial Training Phase:** Train the model using a basic set of augmentations.
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor validation loss and accuracy to assess the learning phase.
4. **Adaptive Augmentation:** Adjust augmentation techniques based on the current learning phase.
5. **Evaluation:** Compare the performance of the adaptive augmentation framework against a baseline with static augmentations.

### 3. Datasets

1. **CIFAR-10** (source: Hugging Face Datasets)
   - Description: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Source URL: [CIFAR-10 on Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)

2. **IMDB Reviews** (source: Hugging Face Datasets)
   - Description: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
   - Source URL: [IMDB on Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb)

### 4. Model Architecture

1. **Image Classification:**
   - **Model:** ResNet-18
   - **Library:** PyTorch

2. **Text Classification:**
   - **Model:** BERT (Base, Uncased)
   - **Library:** Hugging Face Transformers

### 5. Hyperparameters

**For ResNet-18 (Image Classification):**
- Learning Rate: `0.001`
- Batch Size: `64`
- Epochs: `50`
- Optimizer: `Adam`

**For BERT (Text Classification):**
- Learning Rate: `2e-5`
- Batch Size: `32`
- Epochs: `3`
- Optimizer: `AdamW`

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

1. **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified samples.
2. **Loss:** Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
3. **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
4. **Robustness Metric:** Evaluate performance on adversarial examples or augmented test sets.
5. **Generalization Metric:** Performance on a separate validation dataset not seen during training.

### Summary

This experiment plan outlines the steps to test an adaptive data augmentation framework for improving AI/ML model performance. By monitoring the modelâ€™s learning phase and adjusting the augmentation techniques accordingly, we aim to enhance generalization and robustness in low-resource environments. The experiment will be conducted on both image and text classification tasks using well-known datasets and state-of-the-art model architectures.

```python
batch_size = 32
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
batch_size = 64  # Increased batch size
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
```

### File: train.py
**Original Code:**
```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train_one_epoch(model, optimizer, train_loader)

    print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {eval_loss}, Accuracy: {eval_accuracy}')

    if eval_loss < best_eval_loss:
        best_eval_loss = eval_loss
        patience_counter = 0
        # Save the best model
        torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_model.pth')
    else:
        patience_counter += 1

    if patience_counter >= patience:
        print("Early stopping triggered")
        break

# Load the best model for evaluation
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('best_model.pth'))
