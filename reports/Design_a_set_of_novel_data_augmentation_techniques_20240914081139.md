## Idea
Design a set of novel data augmentation techniques specifically tailored for limited computational resources. These techniques could focus on generating diverse and representative synthetic data samples using lightweight generative models or augmentation algorithms that require minimal computation.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Testing Novel Data Augmentation Techniques for Limited Computational Resources

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of novel data augmentation techniques designed specifically for environments with limited computational resources. We aim to determine whether these lightweight augmentation strategies can improve the performance of machine learning models without demanding significant computational power.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Baseline Model Training**:
   - Train models on the original datasets without any augmentation to establish baseline performance.
   
2. **Design Augmentation Techniques**:
   - Develop a set of lightweight generative models or augmentation algorithms. Examples include:
     - Simple geometric transformations (e.g., rotations, translations).
     - Color space augmentations (e.g., brightness, contrast adjustments).
     - Lightweight generative models (e.g., variational autoencoders, simple GANs).
   
3. **Generate Augmented Data**:
   - Use the designed augmentation techniques to generate synthetic data samples.
   
4. **Training with Augmented Data**:
   - Train models using the augmented datasets.
   
5. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Compare the performance of models trained on original vs. augmented datasets.
   
6. **Resource Utilization Analysis**:
   - Measure computational resources utilized during training (e.g., CPU/GPU usage, memory consumption).

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels, in 10 classes.
- **Hugging Face Datasets Source**:
  - `cifar10` from Hugging Face Datasets
  - `mnist` from Hugging Face Datasets

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification tasks.
  - CIFAR-10 Model: ResNet-18
  - MNIST Model: LeNet-5

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **CIFAR-10 Model (ResNet-18)**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 50
  - Optimizer: Adam
- **MNIST Model (LeNet-5)**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.01
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 20
  - Optimizer: SGD

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total samples.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Resource Utilization Metrics**:
  - CPU/GPU usage during training.
  - Memory consumption.
  - Training time.

### Implementation Details
1. **Baseline Training**:
   - Train ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 and LeNet-5 on MNIST without any augmentation. Record the performance metrics.
   
2. **Augmentation Implementation**:
   - Implement geometric transformations, color space augmentations, and lightweight generative models.
   
3. **Augmented Data Training**:
   - Generate augmented datasets using the implemented techniques.
   - Train the same models on these augmented datasets.
   
4. **Comparison and Analysis**:
   - Compare the performance and resource utilization metrics between baseline and augmented data training.
   - Assess if the lightweight augmentation techniques provide a significant performance boost without excessive resource requirements.

### Conclusion
By systematically comparing the performance and resource utilization of models trained on original and augmented datasets, this experiment aims to validate the hypothesis that novel, lightweight data augmentation techniques can enhance AI research systems' performance in resource-constrained environments.
