# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning with Meta-Lear

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning with Meta-Learning**: Develop a lightweight meta-learning framework that can dynamically adjust hyperparameters during training based on real-time performance metrics. This system should use a single GPU to evaluate small batches and adjust settings like learning rate, batch size, and regularization parameters on-the-fly to optimize training efficiency and minimize overfitting.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning framework that can dynamically adjust hyperparameters during training based on real-time performance metrics. This framework aims to optimize training efficiency and minimize overfitting by tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization parameters on-the-fly using a single GPU.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Framework Development:**
   - Implement a meta-learning algorithm that can monitor training performance in real-time and adjust hyperparameters dynamically.
   - Use reinforcement learning (RL) or a simple gradient-based approach for the meta-learner to make adjustments.
   
2. **Training Procedure:**
   - Divide the training process into episodes where the meta-learner evaluates the model's performance on small batches.
   - Based on performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy, etc.), the meta-learner adjusts hyperparameters before the next episode begins.
   - Continue this process iteratively until the entire training dataset is processed.

3. **Baseline Comparison:**
   - Train the same model using traditional hyperparameter tuning methods (e.g., grid search, random search) for comparison.
   - Evaluate the performance and training efficiency differences.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Use a single GPU for both model training and meta-learning to ensure resource efficiency.
   - Implement the meta-learning framework in Python using libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

#### 3. Datasets
For this experiment, we will use datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Source: [CIFAR-10 on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)

2. **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
   - Source: [IMDB on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb)

These datasets are chosen to evaluate the framework on both image classification and text classification tasks.

#### 4. Model Architecture
1. **For CIFAR-10:**
   - Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   - Architecture: 
     - Input Layer: 32x32x3
     - Convolutional Layers: Multiple conv layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling
     - Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
     - Output Layer: Softmax layer for 10 classes
   
2. **For IMDB:**
   - Model Type: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   - Architecture:
     - Input Layer: Tokenized words
     - LSTM Layers: Stacked LSTM layers
     - Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
     - Output Layer: Sigmoid layer for binary classification

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters to be tuned dynamically by the meta-learning framework are:

1. **Learning Rate:**
   - Initial Value: 0.001
   - Range: [1e-5, 1e-1]

2. **Batch Size:**
   - Initial Value: 32
   - Range: [16, 128]

3. **Regularization Parameters:**
   - Dropout Rate: 
     - Initial Value: 0.5
     - Range: [0.1, 0.7]
   - L2 Regularization:
     - Initial Value: 0.01
     - Range: [1e-5, 1e-2]

4. **Number of Layers:** (For CNN)
   - Initial Value: 3
   - Range: [2, 5]

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the meta-learning framework, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Training Efficiency:**
   - Measure the total training time until convergence.
   - Compute the number of epochs required to reach a specific validation accuracy.

2. **Model Performance:**
   - Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions on the test set.
   - Loss: Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.

3. **Overfitting Assessment:**
   - Validation Accuracy: Monitor the gap between training and validation accuracy.
   - Validation Loss: Monitor the increase in validation loss to assess overfitting.

4. **Hyperparameter Adaptation Analysis:**
   - Track the changes in hyperparameters over time.
   - Evaluate how quickly and effectively the meta-learner adapts to different training phases.

By comparing these metrics against baseline models trained with traditional hyperparameter tuning methods, we can determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed adaptive hyperparameter tuning framework.
