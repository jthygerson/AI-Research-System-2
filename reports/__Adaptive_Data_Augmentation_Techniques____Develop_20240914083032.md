# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Data Augmentation Techniques**: Develop

## Idea
**Adaptive Data Augmentation Techniques**: Develop a lightweight, adaptive data augmentation framework that dynamically adjusts augmentation strategies based on real-time feedback from model performance metrics. This could involve creating a small neural network that predicts the best augmentation techniques for a given batch of data to optimize model accuracy and robustness.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Data Augmentation Techniques

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive data augmentation framework that dynamically adjusts augmentation strategies based on real-time feedback from model performance metrics. The aim is to improve model accuracy and robustness by optimizing the augmentation techniques applied to the training data.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Framework Development**:
    - Develop a small neural network (AugNet) that predicts the best augmentation technique for each batch of data.
    - The AugNet will take as input the current model's performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) and output the augmentation parameters to be used for the next batch.
  
2. **Training Loop**:
    - Initialize the primary model (PrimaryNet) with a standard configuration.
    - For each epoch, split the training data into batches.
    - For each batch:
        1. Use AugNet to determine the augmentation strategy.
        2. Apply the chosen augmentations to the batch.
        3. Train PrimaryNet on the augmented batch.
        4. Collect performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) from PrimaryNet.
    - Feed the collected performance metrics back into AugNet to update its parameters.
  
3. **Baseline Comparison**:
    - Train PrimaryNet with standard, non-adaptive augmentation techniques (e.g., random cropping, flipping) for comparison.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images in 10 classes.
- **Hugging Face Datasets**:
    - For text classification, we will use **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification with 50,000 movie reviews.
    - For sequence tagging, we will use **CoNLL-2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **PrimaryNet**:
    - For image classification: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:
        - Input Layer: 32x32x3 (CIFAR-10)
        - Conv Layer: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
        - Max Pooling: 2x2

        - Fully Connected Layer: 128 units, ReLU activation
        - Output Layer: 10 units, Softmax activation
    - For text classification: A Bidirectional LSTM with the following layers:

        - Bi-LSTM Layer: 64 units
        - Fully Connected Layer: 128 units, ReLU activation

    - Batch Size: 32
    - Epochs: 50

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Loss**: The cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
- **Robustness**: Measured by the model's performance on adversarially perturbed data.
- **Training Time**: The total time taken to train the model, including the time taken by AugNet to predict augmentation strategies.

By conducting this experiment, we aim to validate the hypothesis that adaptive data augmentation techniques can significantly enhance the performance and robustness of AI/ML models.
