# Experiment Report: 1. **Optimization of Hyperparameter Search using M

## Idea
1. **Optimization of Hyperparameter Search using Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that utilizes past hyperparameter tuning results from various models to predict optimal hyperparameters for new models. This can significantly reduce the search space and computation time needed for hyperparameter optimization, making it feasible on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan to Test the Optimization of Hyperparameter Search using Meta-Learning

---

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and assess a meta-learning algorithm that leverages past hyperparameter tuning results to predict optimal hyperparameters for new models. The goal is to reduce the search space and computation time required for hyperparameter optimization, making it feasible to perform on a single GPU.

#### 2. Methodology

1. **Data Collection of Past Hyperparameter Results**:
    - Aggregate past hyperparameter tuning results from various models across different datasets. This includes the hyperparameter values and corresponding performance metrics.

2. **Meta-Feature Extraction**:
    - For each model-dataset pair, extract meta-features such as dataset characteristics (e.g., number of samples, number of features, class distribution) and model architecture details (e.g., number of layers, type of layers).

3. **Meta-Learning Algorithm Development**:
    - Develop a meta-learning algorithm that maps the meta-features to optimal hyperparameters. This can be achieved using regression models or neural networks trained on the aggregated data.

4. **Training the Meta-Learning Model**:
    - Split the aggregated data into training and validation sets.
    - Train the meta-learning model to predict the performance of a given set of hyperparameters on a new model-dataset pair.
    - Fine-tune the meta-learning model to improve its generalization capability.

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization on New Models**:
    - Use the trained meta-learning model to predict optimal hyperparameters for new, unseen models and datasets.
    - Compare the performance and computation time of the predicted hyperparameters with traditional hyperparameter optimization methods (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization).

#### 3. Datasets

- **Hugging Face Datasets**:
    - CIFAR-10 (image classification)

    - MNIST (handwritten digit classification)
    - Fashion-MNIST (fashion item classification)

These datasets are chosen to cover different types of tasks (image classification, text classification) and varying levels of complexity.

#### 4. Model Architecture

- **Types of Models**:
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification (e.g., ResNet, VGG)
