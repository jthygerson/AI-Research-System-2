# Experiment Report: Investigate a method to dynamically adjust the lea

## Idea
Investigate a method to dynamically adjust the learning rate of a neural network based on the uncertainty of its predictions. Utilize Bayesian methods or dropout techniques to estimate uncertainty and adaptively modify the learning rate during training to improve convergence speed and model performance.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment Based on Prediction Uncertainty

### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to investigate the potential benefits of dynamically adjusting the learning rate of a neural network based on the uncertainty of its predictions. By utilizing Bayesian methods or dropout techniques to estimate uncertainty, the experiment aims to adaptively modify the learning rate during training to improve both convergence speed and overall model performance.

### 2. Methodology
#### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Model Initialization**: Initialize a neural network model and a baseline model with a fixed learning rate for performance comparison.
2. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Employ Bayesian methods or dropout techniques to estimate prediction uncertainty at each training iteration.
3. **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment**: Adjust the learning rate based on the estimated uncertainty. Higher uncertainty will lead to a lower learning rate, while lower uncertainty will allow for a higher learning rate.
4. **Training**: Train the model on a selected dataset, applying the dynamic learning rate adjustment technique.
5. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the dynamically adjusted learning rate model with the baseline model using predefined evaluation metrics.

### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and testing.
- **Hugging Face Datasets Source**: `cifar10`, `imdb`

### 4. Model Architecture
- **CIFAR-10 Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - **Layers**:
    - Conv2D -> BatchNorm -> ReLU -> MaxPooling
    - Conv2D -> BatchNorm -> ReLU -> MaxPooling
    - Dense -> ReLU -> Dropout
    - Dense -> Softmax
- **IMDB Reviews Model**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM units
  - **Layers**:
    - Embedding
    - LSTM -> Dropout
    - Dense -> Sigmoid

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Common Hyperparameters**:
  - `initial_learning_rate`: 0.001
  - `batch_size`: 64
  - `epochs`: 50
- **Dropout Rate**: 
  - CNN: 0.5
  - RNN: 0.5
- **Optimizer**: Adam
  - `beta_1`: 0.9
  - `beta_2`: 0.999
  - `epsilon`: 1e-07

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: For IMDB Reviews, these metrics will help in understanding the performance on binary classification.
- **Loss**: Cross-entropy loss for both CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets.
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold or minimum loss.
- **Uncertainty Calibration Metrics**: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) to evaluate how well the uncertainty estimates are calibrated.

### Implementation Notes:
- **Uncertainty Estimation**:
  - Use Monte Carlo Dropout: Perform multiple forward passes with dropout enabled during inference to estimate uncertainty.
  - Alternatively, use Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with variational inference.
- **Learning Rate Adjustment Strategy**:
  - If uncertainty > threshold: decrease learning rate (e.g., `lr = lr * 0.5`)
  - If uncertainty < threshold: increase learning rate (e.g., `lr = lr * 1.1`)
  - Ensure the learning rate stays within reasonable bounds to avoid divergence or excessively slow training.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to validate whether dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on prediction uncertainty can lead to improved convergence speed and overall model performance compared to a fixed learning rate strategy.
