# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develo

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the model's performance and training progress, utilizing a feedback loop mechanism. This could involve integrating reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the learning rate schedule in real-time, aiming to reduce training time and improve model convergence on a single GPU setup.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization

#### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on model performance and training progress. The algorithm will utilize reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the learning rate schedule in real-time, aiming to reduce training time and improve model convergence on a single GPU setup.

#### 2. Methodology

- **Algorithm Development**: 
  - Develop an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm using reinforcement learning. The agent will receive feedback on model performance (e.g., loss, accuracy) and training progress (e.g., epoch number, gradient statistics) to adjust the learning rate dynamically.
  - The RL agent will be implemented using a policy gradient method (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) to learn the optimal learning rate adjustments.

- **Experimental Setup**:
  - Train a baseline model with a fixed learning rate schedule for comparison.
  - Train the same model using the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
  - Compare the performance in terms of training time, convergence speed, and final model accuracy.
