# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment using Reinforce

## Idea
**Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment using Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Develop a lightweight RL-based algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on real-time feedback from validation loss. This could help accelerate convergence and improve model performance with minimal computational overhead.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment using Reinforcement Learning (RL)

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a lightweight RL-based algorithm for dynamically adjusting the learning rate during model training. The hypothesis is that such an approach can accelerate convergence and improve model performance with minimal computational overhead compared to traditional static or heuristic-based learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Preparation**: Implement an RL agent that can adjust the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the validation loss.
- **Training**: Use the RL agent to dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training of different models on selected datasets.
- **Comparison**: Compare the performance of models trained with the RL-based learning rate adjustment against models trained with traditional learning rate schedules (e.g., fixed, step decay, cosine annealing).
- **Evaluation**: Assess the models' performance using standard evaluation metrics to determine the effectiveness of the RL-based learning rate adjustment.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification, also available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **SQuAD v2.0**: A dataset for question answering, available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-50 for CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Text Classification**: BERT-base for IMDB Reviews dataset.
- **Question Answering**: BERT-large for SQuAD v2.0 dataset.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: `0.001` (for all models)
- **Batch Size**: `64` (for CIFAR-10 and IMDB), `16` (for SQuAD v2.0)
- **Epochs**: `50` (for CIFAR-10 and IMDB), `10` (for SQuAD v2.0)
- **RL Agent Parameters**:
  - **State Space**: Validation loss and current learning rate
  - **Action Space**: Multiplicative factors to adjust learning rate (e.g., {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0})
  - **Reward**: Negative change in validation loss
  - **Policy Network**: Simple MLP with one hidden layer of 128 units
  - **Discount Factor**: `0.99`
  - **Learning Rate**: `0.001` (for the RL agent itself)
- **Baseline Learning Rate Schedules**:
  - **Fixed**: `0.001`
  - **Step Decay**: Reduce by `0.1` every `10` epochs
  - **Cosine Annealing**: Cosine annealing schedule with initial learning rate `0.001`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Validation Loss**: Primary metric for monitoring training and RL agent performance.
- **Accuracy**: For CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets.
- **F1 Score**: For IMDB Reviews (binary classification).
- **Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score**: For SQuAD v2.0.
- **Training Time**: To evaluate computational overhead.
- **Convergence Epoch**: The epoch at which the model reaches a stable validation loss.

This experiment plan will help in systematically assessing the impact of dynamic learning rate adjustment using RL on model performance and training efficiency across different types of tasks and datasets.
