# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning Using Reinforceme

## Idea
**Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning Using Reinforcement Learning:** Develop a reinforcement learning-based system that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters during training to optimize performance with minimal computational overhead. The system will learn from previous training runs to make more informed adjustments, improving training efficiency and model performance.

## Experiment Plan
**Experiment Plan: Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning Using Reinforcement Learning**

---

### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning (RL) system that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters during model training. The goal is to optimize training efficiency and model performance with minimal computational overhead. The RL system will learn from previous training runs to make more informed hyperparameter adjustments in real-time.

### 2. Methodology

1. **RL Agent Design**: 
   - Develop a reinforcement learning agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Learning (DQN).
   - The state space will include current hyperparameter values, validation loss, and training progress.
   - The action space will consist of possible adjustments to hyperparameters (e.g., increase/decrease learning rate).

2. **Training Loop Integration**:
   - Integrate the RL agent into the model training loop such that it can adjust hyperparameters at predetermined intervals (e.g., after each epoch or batch).
   - Implement a reward function that incentivizes the RL agent to minimize validation loss and training time.

3. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Train models with static hyperparameters using grid search or random search for baseline comparison.
   - Compare the performance and efficiency of the RL-based tuning with these traditional methods.

4. **Iteration and Learning**:
   - Allow the RL agent to accumulate experience over multiple training runs.
   - Use this experience to refine its hyperparameter adjustment strategy.

### 4. Model Architecture

Different model architectures will be used depending on the dataset type:

1. **Image Classification**:
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers: Conv2D -> MaxPooling -> Conv2D -> MaxPooling -> Flatten -> Dense -> Output.

2. **Text Classification**:
   - Bidirectional LSTM with the following layers: Embedding -> BiLSTM -> Dense -> Output.

3. **Tabular Data**:
   - Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) with the following layers: Dense -> Dense -> Output.

### 5. Hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters will be dynamically adjusted by the RL agent:

1. **Learning Rate**: Initial value: 0.001 (possible range: 1e-5 to 1e-1)
2. **Batch Size**: Initial value: 32 (possible range: 16 to 128)
3. **Dropout Rate**: Initial value: 0.5 (possible range: 0.1 to 0.7)
4. **Number of Layers**: Initial value: 2 (possible range: 1 to 4)
5. **Units per Layer**: Initial value: 64 (possible range: 32 to 256)

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance and efficiency of the RL-based hyperparameter tuning system, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Model Performance**:
   - Accuracy (for classification tasks)
   - F1 Score (for imbalanced classification tasks)
   - Mean Squared Error (for regression tasks, if any)

2. **Training Efficiency**:
   - Training Time: Total time taken to complete the training process.
   - Computational Overhead: Extra computation time introduced by the RL agent.
   - Convergence Speed: Number of epochs/batches to reach a performance plateau.

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization Quality**:
   - Final Validation Loss: Comparison between RL-tuned and baseline models.
   - Stability of Adjustments: Variability in hyperparameter values across training runs.

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          
    num_train_epochs=5,              # Increased number of epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,

    logging_steps=10,
    learning_rate=2e-5,              # Adjusted learning rate

# Additional changes for data augmentation (if applicable):
# Assuming use of a dataset library that supports data augmentation
from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    mlm=True,
    mlm_probability=0.15

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                         
    args=training_args,

    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,           
    data_collator=data_collator,         # Added data collator for augmentation

# If using a different model architecture:
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                         
    args=training_args,
