# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules with Meta-Learn

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules with Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm to dynamically adjust the learning rate schedules of neural networks during training. This approach could improve convergence speed and stability, particularly for models trained on single GPUs, by learning optimal schedules from previous training runs.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate schedules of neural networks during training. The hypothesis is that such an approach can improve convergence speed and stability, particularly for models trained on single GPUs, by learning optimal schedules from previous training runs.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Meta-Learning Algorithm Development**:
   - Develop a meta-learner that can predict optimal learning rates at different stages of training.
   - The meta-learner will be trained using data from previous training runs (meta-training data).
   - Use reinforcement learning or gradient-based meta-learning to optimize the learning rate schedules.

2. **Training Phases**:
   - **Meta-Training Phase**: Collect data from multiple training runs using standard learning rate schedules. Train the meta-learner on this data.
   - **Meta-Testing Phase**: Use the trained meta-learner to adjust the learning rate schedules dynamically during the training of new models.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Implement the meta-learning algorithm in a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
   - Integrate the meta-learner with existing training loops for neural network models.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the performance of models trained with the adaptive learning rate schedules against models trained with standard fixed or hand-tuned learning rate schedules.
   - Perform statistical analysis to determine the significance of any observed improvements.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.
- **Hugging Face Datasets**: 
  - `cifar10` (https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)
  - `mnist` (https://huggingface.co/datasets/mnist)
  - `imdb` (https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb)

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for CIFAR-10 and MNIST:
  - Input Layer
  - 2-3 Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling
  - Fully Connected Layer
  - Output Layer with Softmax activation
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells for IMDB:
  - Embedding Layer
  - LSTM Layer
  - Fully Connected Layer
  - Output Layer with Sigmoid activation

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Learning Rate Scheduler Parameters** (for baseline comparison):
  - StepLR: `step_size=10`, `gamma=0.1`
  - ExponentialLR: `gamma=0.9`
- **Meta-Learner Parameters**:
  - Learning Rate for Meta-Learner: 0.0001
  - Meta-Training Episodes: 100

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs to reach a specified accuracy threshold (e.g., 90% for CIFAR-10 and MNIST, 85% for IMDB).
- **Final Accuracy**: Accuracy on the test set after training completes.
- **Loss**: Final loss value on the test set.
- **Stability**: Variance in accuracy and loss across multiple training runs.
- **Training Time**: Total time taken for training until convergence.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to validate whether adaptive learning rate schedules controlled by a meta-learning algorithm can indeed enhance the training efficiency and stability of neural networks across different datasets and model architectures.
