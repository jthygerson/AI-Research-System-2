## Idea
**Memory-Efficient Transformer Models**: Design a memory-efficient variant of transformer architectures that reduces the computational burden of self-attention mechanisms. This could involve approximations or low-rank factorization techniques that maintain performance while significantly lowering memory usage, making it feasible to run on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Memory-Efficient Transformer Models

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate a memory-efficient variant of transformer architectures that reduces the computational burden of self-attention mechanisms. The aim is to maintain model performance while significantly lowering memory usage, making the models feasible to run on a single GPU. The experiment will involve implementing approximations or low-rank factorization techniques in the transformer model and comparing its performance and memory usage against standard transformer models.

#### 2. Methodology
The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Design**: Develop a memory-efficient transformer model by integrating low-rank factorization or other approximation techniques into the self-attention mechanism.
2. **Implementation**: Implement the designed model using a popular deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).
3. **Training**: Train both the standard transformer model and the memory-efficient variant on selected datasets.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance and memory usage of both models using predefined evaluation metrics.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the trade-offs between memory efficiency and model performance.

#### 3. Datasets
For this experiment, we will use datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
1. **GLUE Benchmark**: A collection of multiple NLP tasks. This will allow us to evaluate the generalization of our model across various tasks.
   - Dataset Name: `glue`
   - Source: [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue)
   
2. **Wikitext-103**: A large-scale language modeling dataset.
   - Dataset Name: `wikitext`
   - Source: [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext)

#### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Standard Transformer Model**: We will use the BERT architecture as our baseline model.
   - Model Type: `bert-base-uncased`
   - Source: [Hugging Face Models](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)
   
2. **Memory-Efficient Transformer Model**: This model will incorporate a low-rank factorization technique in the self-attention mechanism to reduce memory usage.
   - Model Type: Custom variant of `bert-base-uncased` with low-rank factorization in self-attention layers.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Here are the hyperparameters for training both the standard and memory-efficient models:
- `learning_rate`: 2e-5
- `batch_size`: 16
- `epochs`: 3
- `max_seq_length`: 128
- `optimizer`: AdamW
- `weight_decay`: 0.01
- `dropout_rate`: 0.1
- `rank_factorization`: 16 (only for memory-efficient model)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation metrics to be used for this experiment are:
1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: For classification tasks in the GLUE benchmark.
   - **F1 Score**: For tasks with imbalanced classes (e.g., MRPC, QQP from GLUE).
   - **Perplexity**: For the language modeling task on Wikitext-103.

2. **Memory Usage Metrics**:
   - **Peak GPU Memory Usage**: Measured during the training process.
   - **Inference Memory Footprint**: Measured during model inference.

3. **Computational Efficiency Metrics**:
   - **Training Time**: Total training time per epoch.
   - **Inference Time**: Average inference time per sample.

#### Notes
- The experiment will involve multiple runs to ensure statistical significance of the results.
- Both models will be trained and evaluated under the same hardware conditions to ensure fair comparison.
- Detailed logging and monitoring will be conducted to track the performance and resource usage during the experiment.

This experiment plan aims to systematically evaluate the benefits and limitations of memory-efficient transformer models, providing insights into their practical applicability in resource-constrained environments.
