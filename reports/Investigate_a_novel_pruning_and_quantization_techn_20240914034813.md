# Experiment Report: Investigate a novel pruning and quantization techn

## Idea
Investigate a novel pruning and quantization technique that preserves the accuracy of neural networks while significantly reducing their size and computational requirements. The research would involve creating a hybrid method that combines layer-wise pruning with adaptive quantization based on the importance of different layers and neurons.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a novel pruning and quantization technique that combines layer-wise pruning with adaptive quantization. The goal is to preserve the accuracy of neural networks while significantly reducing their size and computational requirements. This hybrid method will be tested on standard image classification and natural language processing tasks to assess its effectiveness and generalizability.

### 2. Methodology

#### Step 1: Baseline Model Training
- Train baseline models without any pruning or quantization on the selected datasets.
- Record baseline accuracy, model size, and computational requirements.

#### Step 2: Layer-wise Pruning
- Implement layer-wise pruning. Remove a fraction of the least important neurons in each layer based on their contribution to the overall network performance.
- Importance of neurons can be determined using metrics such as weight magnitude or contribution to the output.

#### Step 3: Adaptive Quantization
- Apply adaptive quantization to the pruned model. Quantize weights and activations based on the importance of different layers and neurons.
- More important layers and neurons receive higher precision, while less important ones receive lower precision.

#### Step 4: Hybrid Method
- Combine the layer-wise pruning and adaptive quantization into a single workflow.
- Fine-tune the hybrid model to recover any lost accuracy.

#### Step 5: Evaluation
- Compare the hybrid model's performance with the baseline and individual pruning/quantization models.
- Metrics for comparison include accuracy, model size, and computational requirements.
