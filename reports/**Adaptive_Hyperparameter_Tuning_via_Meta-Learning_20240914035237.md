# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning

## Idea
**Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning:** Develop a meta-learning algorithm that can dynamically adapt hyperparameters during training based on real-time feedback from model performance metrics. This approach can be implemented on a single GPU by leveraging efficient checkpointing and gradient-based optimization.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adapts hyperparameters during the training process based on real-time feedback from model performance metrics. The goal is to enhance the performance and efficiency of AI models by automatically fine-tuning hyperparameters, thereby reducing the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will follow these steps:
1. **Setup and Initialization**:
   - Select a base model architecture and initial hyperparameters.
   - Implement the meta-learning algorithm to adjust hyperparameters in real-time.
   - Use efficient checkpointing and gradient-based optimization to manage computational resources.

2. **Training Loop**:
   - Train the base model on the selected dataset.
   - At regular intervals (e.g., every epoch or batch), evaluate the model's performance using validation data.
   - Use the meta-learning algorithm to adjust hyperparameters based on the performance metrics.

3. **Meta-Learning Algorithm**:
   - Implement a meta-learning algorithm that uses gradient-based optimization to update hyperparameters.
   - The algorithm will take as input the performance metrics and current hyperparameters and output adjusted hyperparameters.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of the model with adaptive hyperparameter tuning against a baseline model with static hyperparameters.
   - Use predefined evaluation metrics to assess performance improvements.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets will be used:
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`cifar10`)
- **Natural Language Processing**: IMDB Reviews (`imdb`)
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Electricity Load Diagrams (`electricity`)

#### 4. Model Architecture
The experiment will use different model architectures for each task:
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-18
- **Natural Language Processing**: BERT (base-uncased)
- **Time Series Forecasting**: LSTM Network

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Initial hyperparameters for each model:
- **ResNet-18 (Image Classification)**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Momentum: 0.9
  - Weight Decay: 1e-4
  
- **BERT (NLP)**:
  - Learning Rate: 2e-5
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Max Sequence Length: 128
  - Warmup Steps: 1000

- **LSTM (Time Series)**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.01
  - Batch Size: 128
  - Hidden Units: 64
  - Dropout Rate: 0.5

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**:
  - Accuracy
  - F1 Score

- **Natural Language Processing (IMDB)**:
  - Accuracy
  - F1 Score (Macro)

- **Time Series Forecasting (Electricity)**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

By conducting this experiment, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive hyperparameter tuning via meta-learning and its potential to significantly enhance model performance across different AI/ML tasks.
