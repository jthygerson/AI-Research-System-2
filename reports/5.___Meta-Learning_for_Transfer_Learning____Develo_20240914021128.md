## Code Changes

### File: train_model.py
**Original Code:**
```python
model = Model()
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
num_epochs = 1
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

model = Model()
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005)  # Reduced learning rate for finer convergence
scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=5, gamma=0.1)  # Learning rate scheduler for dynamic adjustment
num_epochs = 10  # Increased number of epochs

# Include scheduler step in training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train(model, optimizer)  # Assuming train is a function that trains the model for one epoch
    scheduler.step()  # Adjust the learning rate
```

### File: data_preprocessing.py
**Original Code:**
```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),  # Randomly flip images horizontally
    transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),  # Randomly crop the images with padding
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])
```

## Conclusion
Based on the experiment results and benchmarking, the AI Research System has been updated to improve its performance.
