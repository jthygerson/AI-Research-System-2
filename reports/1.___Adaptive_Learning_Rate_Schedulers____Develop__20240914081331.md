# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers**: Develop 

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers**: Develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics, such as validation loss and gradient norms. Implement and test the scheduler on a standard dataset to demonstrate improved convergence rates and model accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Testing Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers

### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics (e.g., validation loss and gradient norms). The goal is to demonstrate that this adaptive scheduler leads to improved convergence rates and model accuracy when compared to traditional fixed or pre-defined learning rate schedules.

### 2. Methodology
**Step 1: Development of Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler**
- Design an adaptive learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate based on real-time metrics:
  - Validation loss: Decrease the learning rate if the validation loss plateaus or increases.
  - Gradient norms: Increase the learning rate if the gradient norms suggest the model is not learning efficiently.

**Step 2: Implementation**
- Implement the adaptive learning rate scheduler in a popular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

**Step 3: Experiment Setup**
- Select a standard dataset from Hugging Face Datasets.
- Choose a model architecture suitable for the dataset.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train the model using both the adaptive learning rate scheduler and a baseline learning rate scheduler (e.g., a fixed learning rate or a step decay schedule).

**Step 4: Comparison and Analysis**
- Compare the performance of models trained with the adaptive learning rate scheduler and the baseline scheduler.
- Evaluate convergence rates and final model accuracy.
- Perform statistical analysis to ensure the observed differences are significant.

### 3. Datasets
- **Dataset Name:** CIFAR-10
- **Source:** Hugging Face Datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)
- **Description:** The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is already divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Architecture:** A simple CNN with the following layers:
  - Input layer: 32x32x3 images
  - Conv2D layer: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
  - MaxPooling2D layer: 2x2 pool size
  - Conv2D layer: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
  - MaxPooling2D layer: 2x2 pool size
  - Flatten layer
  - Dense layer: 128 units, ReLU activation
  - Output layer: 10 units, softmax activation

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Initial Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Baseline Scheduler:** Step Decay (reduce learning rate by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs)
- **Adaptive Scheduler Parameters:**
  - Validation Loss Tolerance: 3 epochs (reduce learning rate if validation loss does not improve for 3 consecutive epochs)
  - Gradient Norm Threshold: 0.1 (increase learning rate if gradient norm is below this threshold)

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Loss:** To monitor the loss during training.
- **Validation Loss:** To determine the effectiveness of the learning rate scheduler.
- **Accuracy:** Both training and validation accuracy to measure the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Convergence Rate:** Number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold.
- **Final Model Accuracy:** Accuracy on the test set after training completion.
- **Learning Rate Dynamics:** Visualization of how the learning rate changes over epochs.
- **Statistical significance tests:** Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the performance metrics between the adaptive scheduler and the baseline.
