# Experiment Report: 1. **Efficient Sparse Training Techniques**: Devel

## Idea
1. **Efficient Sparse Training Techniques**: Develop a novel sparse training algorithm that selectively activates and updates only a small subset of neurons or parameters during each training iteration. The focus would be on creating a dynamic sparsity pattern that adapts based on the data and learning stage, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan to Test Efficient Sparse Training Techniques

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to assess the efficacy of a novel sparse training algorithm that dynamically adapts sparsity patterns based on the data and learning stage. The aim is to reduce computational overhead while maintaining or improving the model's accuracy. This will be achieved by selectively activating and updating only a small subset of neurons or parameters during each training iteration.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Develop an algorithm that can dynamically determine which neurons or parameters to activate and update during each training iteration.
   - Implement the algorithm in a popular deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).

2. **Baseline Model Training**:
   - Train a baseline dense model using traditional training methods for comparison.

3. **Sparse Model Training**:
   - Train the model using the novel sparse training algorithm.
   - Implement a mechanism to adapt sparsity patterns dynamically based on the data and the stage of learning.

4. **Comparison and Analysis**:
   - Compare the performance of the sparse model against the baseline dense model in terms of accuracy, computational overhead, and training time.
   - Analyze the sparsity patterns and their evolution over the course of training.
