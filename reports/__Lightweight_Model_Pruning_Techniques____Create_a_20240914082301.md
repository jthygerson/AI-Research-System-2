# Experiment Report: **Lightweight Model Pruning Techniques**: Create a

## Idea
**Lightweight Model Pruning Techniques**: Create a novel pruning technique that incrementally prunes neurons or connections based on their contribution to model performance during training. This technique should be efficient enough to run on a single GPU and aim to maintain or even enhance model accuracy while reducing its size.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this experiment is to create and test a novel, lightweight model pruning technique that incrementally prunes neurons or connections based on their contribution to model performance during training. This technique will be designed to run efficiently on a single GPU and aims to maintain or enhance the model's accuracy while significantly reducing its size.

### 2. Methodology

**Step 1: Initial Model Training**

- Begin with training a baseline model without any pruning to establish a performance benchmark.
- Utilize standard training procedures with backpropagation on a selected dataset.
  
**Step 2: Development of Pruning Technique**

- Develop a lightweight pruning algorithm that measures the contribution of each neuron or connection to the model's performance.
- Implement an incremental pruning strategy that periodically evaluates and prunes less important neurons or connections during the training process.
  
**Step 3: Incremental Pruning during Training**

- Integrate the pruning technique into the model's training loop.
- At predefined intervals (e.g., after every epoch), evaluate the importance of neurons/connections and prune the least important ones.
- Continue training the pruned model to allow it to adjust and fine-tune its weights.

**Step 4: Evaluation**

- Compare the performance of the pruned model to the baseline model in terms of accuracy, model size, and computational efficiency.
- Conduct multiple runs to ensure the consistency and reliability of the results.

### 3. Datasets

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
- Both datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets.

### 4. Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: For CIFAR-10, a standard CNN architecture with the following layers:
  - Conv2D -> ReLU -> MaxPooling -> Conv2D -> ReLU -> MaxPooling -> Fully Connected -> Softmax.
- **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)**: For MNIST, a simple FCNN with the following layers:
  - Input -> FC -> ReLU -> FC -> ReLU -> Output -> Softmax.

### 5. Hyperparameters

- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Number of Epochs**: 50
- **Pruning Interval**: Every 5 epochs
- **Pruning Rate**: 10% of neurons/connections per interval
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**

- **Accuracy**: Measure the classification accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Model Size**: Evaluate the size of the model in terms of the number of parameters before and after pruning.

**Secondary Metrics:**

- **Training Time**: Measure the total training time required for both the baseline and pruned models.
- **Inference Time**: Measure the time taken to make predictions on the test dataset.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor GPU memory usage during training and inference for both models.

### Experiment Execution

1. **Baseline Training**: Train the baseline model on the selected datasets and record the primary and secondary metrics.
2. **Pruning Implementation**: Implement the pruning technique in the training loop and retrain the model.
3. **Metric Collection**: Collect the same set of metrics for the pruned model.
4. **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare the metrics of the pruned model against the baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of the pruning technique.

### Conclusion

The results from this experiment will indicate whether the proposed lightweight pruning technique can effectively reduce model size and computational requirements without compromising, or even improving, the model's accuracy.
