### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling Based on Model Uncertainty

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate scheduling based on model uncertainty in improving the performance of machine learning models. Specifically, we aim to determine whether adjusting the learning rate dynamically based on the uncertainty in the model's predictions can lead to better generalization, faster convergence, and improved performance metrics compared to traditional fixed or heuristic learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will be conducted in the following steps:

1. **Baseline Model Training**: Train a baseline model using a conventional fixed or heuristic learning rate schedule (e.g., step decay, exponential decay).
2. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Implement a method to estimate the model's uncertainty during training. This can be achieved using techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout or Bayesian Neural Networks.
3. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler**: Develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate based on the estimated model uncertainty. The learning rate will be higher when uncertainty is high and lower when uncertainty is low.
4. **Experimental Model Training**: Train the model using the adaptive learning rate scheduler.
5. **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare the performance of the baseline model and the experimental model using predefined evaluation metrics.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used for this experiment:

- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`datasets.cifar10`)
- **Natural Language Processing**: IMDB Reviews (`datasets.imdb`)
- **Tabular Data**: UCI Adult Census Income (`datasets.adult`)

These datasets are chosen to cover a range of tasks and domains, ensuring the results are generalizable.

#### 4. Model Architecture
The experiment will be conducted using different model architectures suitable for each dataset:

- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**:
  - Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Architecture: ResNet-18
  
- **Natural Language Processing (IMDB Reviews)**:
  - Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  - Architecture: LSTM with Attention Mechanism
  
- **Tabular Data (UCI Adult Census Income)**:
  - Model: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
  - Architecture: XGBoost

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be used in the initial phase of the experiment. These may be tuned based on preliminary results.

- **Common Hyperparameters**:
  - `batch_size`: 32
  - `epochs`: 100
  - `initial_learning_rate`: 0.001
  - `optimizer`: Adam

- **CNN (ResNet-18)**:
  - `weight_decay`: 0.0001
  - `momentum`: 0.9

- **RNN (LSTM)**:
  - `hidden_units`: 256
  - `dropout_rate`: 0.5

- **GBM (XGBoost)**:
  - `max_depth`: 6
  - `learning_rate`: 0.1
  - `n_estimators`: 100

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

- **Natural Language Processing (IMDB Reviews)**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - AUC-ROC

- **Tabular Data (UCI Adult Census Income)**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - AUC-ROC

Additionally, we will monitor training metrics such as:
- Training Loss
- Validation Loss
- Convergence Rate (measured as epochs to achieve a certain validation loss)

The results will be statistically analyzed to determine the significance of the improvements gained through adaptive learning rate scheduling based on model uncertainty. This experiment will provide insights into the potential benefits and practical implementation of uncertainty-based learning rate adjustments in various machine learning tasks.
