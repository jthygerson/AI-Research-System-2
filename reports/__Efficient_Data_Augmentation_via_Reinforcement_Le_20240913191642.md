### Experiment Plan: Efficient Data Augmentation via Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to test the hypothesis that reinforcement learning (RL) can be effectively used to optimize data augmentation strategies, thereby improving the performance of machine learning models. Specifically, we aim to develop an RL agent that learns to select the most beneficial augmentation techniques for a given dataset, enhancing model accuracy and robustness.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **RL Agent Design**:
    - **State Representation**: The state will represent the current dataset with information such as class distribution, augmentation history, and current model performance metrics.
    - **Action Space**: The action space will consist of various data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, cropping, flipping, color jittering).
    - **Reward Function**: The reward function will be based on the improvement in model performance metrics (e.g., validation accuracy) after applying the augmentation technique.

2. **Training Procedure**:
    - **Initialization**: Start with the original dataset and a pre-trained model.
    - **Episode Loop**: For each episode, the RL agent selects an augmentation technique from the action space and applies it to the dataset.
    - **Model Training**: Train the model on the augmented dataset for a few epochs and evaluate its performance.
    - **Reward Calculation**: Calculate the reward based on the change in model performance.
    - **Agent Update**: Update the RL agent using a suitable RL algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, DQN).

3. **Control Setup**: Train a baseline model using standard data augmentation techniques without the RL agent for comparison.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment analysis consisting of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
- **SQuAD 2.0**: A dataset for question answering containing over 100,000 questions based on Wikipedia articles, with some questions unanswerable by the given text.

These datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**: ResNet-50
- **Sentiment Analysis (IMDB)**: BERT-base-uncased
- **Question Answering (SQuAD 2.0)**: BERT-large-uncased

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **RL Agent Hyperparameters**:
    - Learning Rate: 0.001
    - Discount Factor (γ): 0.99
    - Exploration Rate (ε): 0.1 (decayed over time)
    - Batch Size: 32
- **Model Training Hyperparameters**:
    - Epochs per Episode: 5
    - Batch Size: 64
    - Learning Rate: 0.0001
    - Optimizer: Adam
- **Augmentation Techniques**: 
    - Rotation: [0, 90, 180, 270]
    - Cropping: RandomCrop, CenterCrop
    - Flipping: HorizontalFlip, VerticalFlip
    - Color Jittering: Brightness, Contrast, Saturation

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**:
    - Accuracy
    - F1-Score
- **Sentiment Analysis (IMDB)**:
    - Accuracy
    - F1-Score
- **Question Answering (SQuAD 2.0)**:
    - Exact Match (EM)
    - F1-Score

Additionally, the performance of the RL agent will be evaluated based on:
- **Average Reward**: The average reward per episode.
- **Convergence Rate**: The rate at which the RL agent converges to an optimal policy.

By comparing the performance metrics of models trained with RL-optimized data augmentation against those trained with standard techniques, we can assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
