# Experiment Report: **Real-time Model Compression and Quantization**: 

## Idea
**Real-time Model Compression and Quantization**: Develop a real-time model compression and quantization pipeline that can dynamically adjust the precision of weights and activations during model inference. The aim is to reduce the model size and inference time without sacrificing significant accuracy, making it feasible for deployment on limited hardware.

## Experiment Plan
### Real-time Model Compression and Quantization: Experiment Plan

#### 1. Objective
To develop a real-time model compression and quantization pipeline that dynamically adjusts the precision of weights and activations during model inference. The primary goal is to reduce the model size and inference time without significantly sacrificing accuracy, thereby making the model feasible for deployment on hardware with limited computational resources.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Baseline Model Training** 
  - Train baseline models without compression/quantization on chosen datasets.
- **Step 2: Development of Compression and Quantization Pipeline**
  - Implement dynamic quantization techniques that adjust the precision of weights and activations in real-time based on the workload and available hardware resources.
- **Step 3: Integration and Testing**
  - Integrate the compression and quantization pipeline with baseline models.
  - Test the pipeline during inference to ensure that it can dynamically adjust precision without extensive computational overhead.
- **Step 4: Performance Evaluation**
  - Evaluate the performance of the models with the compression and quantization pipeline against the baseline models on various metrics.
