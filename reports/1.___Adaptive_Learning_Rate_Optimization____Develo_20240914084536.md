# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develo

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop a novel algorithm for dynamically adjusting the learning rate of neural networks during training. The algorithm should be capable of identifying optimal learning rate schedules based on real-time performance metrics such as loss convergence patterns and gradient magnitudes, thus improving training efficiency and model performance with limited computational resources.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm designed to dynamically adjust the learning rate of neural networks during training. The goal is to improve training efficiency and model performance by identifying optimal learning rate schedules based on real-time performance metrics such as loss convergence patterns and gradient magnitudes. This approach aims to enhance model accuracy, reduce training time, and optimize computational resources.

### 2. Methodology
The experiment will be conducted in the following phases:

1. **Algorithm Development**: Implement the novel adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm. The algorithm will analyze loss convergence patterns and gradient magnitudes in real-time to adjust the learning rate dynamically.
2. **Baseline Comparison**: Train multiple neural network models using standard learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, cosine annealing) to serve as baselines.
3. **Experimental Training**: Train the same models using the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the models trained with the adaptive learning rate against the baseline models using predefined evaluation metrics.

### 3. Datasets
We will use the following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`cifar10`)
2. **Text Classification**: IMDb Reviews (`imdb`)
3. **Speech Recognition**: LibriSpeech ASR corpus (`librispeech_asr`)
4. **Tabular Data**: Adult Census Income (`adult`)

### 4. Model Architecture
We will use different model architectures suitable for each dataset:

1. **Image Classification**
   - Model: ResNet-18
2. **Text Classification**
   - Model: BERT (base-uncased)
3. **Speech Recognition**
   - Model: Wav2Vec 2.0 (base)
4. **Tabular Data**
   - Model: Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT)

### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters for the experiment are as follows:

1. **Common Hyperparameters**:
   - `batch_size`: 32
   - `epochs`: 100
   - `initial_learning_rate`: 0.001
   - `optimizer`: Adam
2. **Adaptive Learning Rate Specific Hyperparameters**:
   - `window_size`: 10 (Number of epochs to consider for learning rate adjustment)
   - `loss_threshold`: 0.01 (Minimum change in loss to trigger learning rate adjustment)
   - `gradient_threshold`: 0.1 (Threshold for gradient magnitude to adjust learning rate)
   - `learning_rate_decay_factor`: 0.5 (Factor by which to decrease the learning rate)
   - `learning_rate_increase_factor`: 1.1 (Factor by which to increase the learning rate)

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
2. **Loss**: The value of the loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification tasks).
3. **Convergence Time**: The amount of time (in epochs) taken for the model to converge to a stable loss.
4. **Computational Efficiency**: The total computational resources used (e.g., GPU hours).

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the datasets to prepare them for training.
2. **Baseline Training**: Train models using standard learning rate schedules and record performance metrics.
3. **Adaptive Training**: Train models using the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm and record performance metrics.
4. **Comparison**: Compare the performance metrics of baseline models and adaptive models to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to rigorously test the proposed adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm and determine its impact on training efficiency and model performance.
