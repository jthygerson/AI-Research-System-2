### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Dynamic Loss Patterns

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate schedulers that adjust based on dynamic patterns in the loss function during training. We aim to determine whether these dynamic schedulers can outperform traditional, static learning rate schedules in terms of model performance and convergence speed.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Baseline Model Training**  
  Train a set of models using traditional learning rate schedules, such as constant, step decay, and cosine annealing, to establish a performance baseline.
  
- **Step 2: Dynamic Scheduler Implementation**  
  Implement an adaptive learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate based on observed patterns in the loss function. This could include:
  - **Pattern Recognition**: Use short-term moving averages, variance, and rate of change in loss to identify patterns.
  - **Adaptive Adjustment**: Increase or decrease the learning rate based on recognized patterns (e.g., sharp drops, plateaus, oscillations).

- **Step 3: Dynamic Scheduler Training**  
  Train the same models using the adaptive learning rate scheduler.

- **Step 4: Performance Comparison**  
  Compare the models' performance using traditional vs. adaptive learning rate schedules based on various evaluation metrics.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
- **SQuAD v2**: A dataset for question answering with over 100,000 questions.

All datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**:
  - **Model**: ResNet-18
  - **Model**: EfficientNet-B0
- **Text Classification (IMDB)**:
  - **Model**: BERT (bert-base-uncased)
  - **Model**: LSTM with GloVe embeddings
- **Question Answering (SQuAD v2)**:
  - **Model**: BERT (bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad)
  - **Model**: RoBERTa (roberta-base)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.01 (for traditional schedules)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**:
  - **Top-1 Accuracy**
  - **Training Time**
