## Idea
Develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time performance metrics such as loss convergence and validation accuracy. Use reinforcement learning techniques to train a scheduler that can optimize the learning rate for different stages of training.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time performance metrics such as loss convergence and validation accuracy. The adaptive scheduler will be trained using reinforcement learning techniques, aiming to optimize the learning rate at different stages of the neural network training process to improve overall model performance.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will be conducted in the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Select a set of benchmark datasets.
   - Choose appropriate model architectures for each dataset.
   - Define a baseline learning rate scheduler (e.g., StepLR or ExponentialLR) for comparison.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Environment Setup**:
   - Define the state space to include real-time performance metrics like current loss, validation accuracy, and the current learning rate.
   - Define the action space as a set of possible adjustments to the learning rate.
   - Implement a reward function that evaluates the performance of the model after each epoch, considering factors such as reduction in loss and improvement in validation accuracy.

3. **Training the Scheduler**:
   - Use a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Learning (DQN)) to train the scheduler.
   - The scheduler will interact with the training process of the model to decide on learning rate adjustments.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of the models trained with the adaptive learning rate scheduler against those trained with baseline schedulers.
   - Use multiple runs to ensure statistical significance of the results.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   - Source: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10`
   - Description: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

2. **IMDB**:
   - Source: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb`
   - Description: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.

3. **SQuAD 2.0**:
   - Source: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad_v2`
   - Description: A dataset for reading comprehension, containing questions with and without answers based on Wikipedia articles.

#### 4. Model Architecture
The following models will be used for the respective datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   - Model: ResNet-18

2. **IMDB**:
   - Model: BERT-base (for text classification)

3. **SQuAD 2.0**:
   - Model: BERT-base (for question answering)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The key hyperparameters for the experiment are as follows:

1. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**:
   - `rl_algorithm`: "PPO" (Proximal Policy Optimization)
   - `gamma`: 0.99 (discount factor)
   - `learning_rate`: 1e-4 (for the RL agent)
   - `num_epochs`: 100 (number of epochs to train the RL agent)

2. **Model Training**:
   - `initial_learning_rate`: 1e-3
   - `batch_size`: 64
   - `num_epochs`: 50 (number of epochs for model training)
   - `optimizer`: "Adam"

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following evaluation metrics will be used to assess the performance of the models:

1. **Training Loss**:
   - Measure of how well the model is fitting the training data.

2. **Validation Accuracy**:
   - Measure of how well the model is generalizing to unseen data.

3. **F1 Score** (for IMDB and SQuAD 2.0):
   - A weighted average of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced classes.

4. **Learning Rate Dynamics**:
   - Track the changes in learning rate over epochs to understand the scheduler's behavior.

5. **Training Time**:
   - Total time taken for training, to evaluate the efficiency of the scheduler.

#### Conclusion
This experiment aims not only to improve model performance through adaptive learning rate scheduling but also to explore the potential of reinforcement learning in optimizing hyperparameters dynamically. The results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive scheduler compared to traditional methods.
