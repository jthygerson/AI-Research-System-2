# Experiment Report: Design a reinforcement learning-based system that 

## Idea
Design a reinforcement learning-based system that autonomously discovers and applies effective data augmentation strategies during training. The system should aim to improve the robustness and accuracy of neural networks by generating diverse and relevant augmented data samples with minimal additional computational overhead.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Reinforcement Learning-Based Data Augmentation System

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate a reinforcement learning (RL) system that autonomously discovers and applies effective data augmentation strategies during the training of neural networks. The aim is to improve the robustness and accuracy of the models, while keeping the additional computational overhead minimal.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Implement an RL agent to autonomously select and apply data augmentation techniques. The agent's actions will include choosing augmentation types (e.g., rotation, flipping, color jittering) and parameters (e.g., angles, probabilities).
- **Environment:** The training process of the neural network will serve as the environment. The state will consist of the current performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss) and the applied augmentations.
- **Reward Function:** Design a reward function based on the improvement in model performance metrics (e.g., validation accuracy) and penalize the agent for excessive computational overhead.
- **Training Loop:** The RL agent will iteratively apply augmentations, update the model, and receive feedback through the reward function.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10:** A widely-used dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
- **MNIST:** A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.
- **IMDB:** A dataset for binary sentiment classification with 50,000 movie reviews.

These datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **CIFAR-10:** Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:
  - Input Layer
  - 2 Convolutional Layers (32 filters each) + ReLU + MaxPooling
  - 2 Convolutional Layers (64 filters each) + ReLU + MaxPooling
  - 2 Fully Connected Layers (512 units each) + ReLU
  - Output Layer with Softmax Activation

- **MNIST:** Use a simpler CNN architecture:
  - Input Layer
  - 2 Convolutional Layers (32 filters each) + ReLU + MaxPooling
  - 1 Fully Connected Layer (128 units) + ReLU
  - Output Layer with Softmax Activation

- **IMDB:** Use an LSTM-based RNN:
  - Embedding Layer
  - LSTM Layer (128 units)
  - Fully Connected Layer (64 units) + ReLU
  - Output Layer with Sigmoid Activation

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **RL Agent:**
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Discount Factor (Gamma): 0.95
  - Exploration Rate: 1.0 (decay to 0.01)
  - Batch Size: 32

- **CNN (CIFAR-10):**
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 50

- **CNN (MNIST):**
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 20

- **LSTM (IMDB):**
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 10

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Measure the overall accuracy of the model on the test set after training.
- **Robustness:** Evaluate the model's performance on perturbed or noisier versions of the test set.
- **Computational Overhead:** Track the additional training time and resources required due to the applied augmentations.
- **Reward Curve:** Plot the reward over time to ensure the RL agent is learning effective augmentation strategies.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to validate the effectiveness of an RL-based data augmentation system in improving the robustness and accuracy of neural networks with minimal computational overhead.

    save_total_limit=2,  # Only keep the last two models
    load_best_model_at_end=True,  # Load the best model when done
