# Experiment Report: **Few-Shot Learning for Transferable Model Compres

## Idea
**Few-Shot Learning for Transferable Model Compression**: Investigate a few-shot learning approach to compress large pre-trained models into smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in performance. The focus would be on creating a method that quickly adapts to different architectures and datasets using minimal computational resources.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan for Few-Shot Learning for Transferable Model Compression

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to investigate a few-shot learning approach for compressing large pre-trained models into smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in performance. The aim is to create a method that can quickly adapt to different architectures and datasets using minimal computational resources. This will enable the deployment of efficient AI models in resource-constrained environments.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Pre-training Stage**:
   - Select a set of large pre-trained models on standard benchmark datasets.
   - Define a few-shot learning approach for model compression using techniques such as knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization.

2. **Few-Shot Learning Stage**:
   - Develop a meta-learning framework that can learn how to compress models efficiently with few samples from the target dataset.
   - Implement a teacher-student paradigm where the large pre-trained model (teacher) guides the training of the smaller model (student).

3. **Adaptation Stage**:
   - Fine-tune the compressed model on a small subset of the target dataset using the learned few-shot learning strategy.
   - Evaluate the model on the target dataset to ensure minimal loss in performance.

4. **Iterative Improvement**:
   - Iterate on the few-shot learning strategy by experimenting with different hyperparameters and architectures to find the optimal compression method.

#### 3. Datasets
- **GLUE Benchmark**: A collection of multiple NLP tasks including SST-2, MNLI, and QNLI.
- **ImageNet**: Large-scale image classification dataset.
- **CIFAR-10/100**: Smaller image classification datasets.
- **SQuAD**: Reading comprehension dataset.
- **Hugging Face Datasets**: Leverage datasets such as "imdb" for sentiment analysis, "ag_news" for news categorization, and "squad_v2" for QA tasks.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Teacher Models**: 
  - BERT (for NLP tasks)
  - ResNet-50 (for image classification tasks)
  - GPT-3 (for generative tasks)
- **Student Models**: 
  - DistilBERT (NLP)
  - MobileNet (image classification)
  - DistilGPT-2 (generative tasks)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-5
- **Batch Size**: 16
- **Number of Training Steps**: 1000
- **Few-Shot Samples**: 5, 10, 20
- **Temperature for Knowledge Distillation**: 2.0
- **Pruning Rate**: 0.2
- **Quantization Bits**: 8 bits

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure the percentage of correctly predicted samples in the classification tasks.
- **F1 Score**: Evaluate the harmonic mean of precision and recall for classification tasks.
- **Perplexity**: Assess the quality of generative models.
- **Compression Ratio**: Evaluate the size reduction achieved by the compressed model.
- **Inference Time**: Measure the time taken to make predictions using the compressed model.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor the computational resources used during training and inference.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to develop a robust few-shot learning framework for model compression that can be easily adapted to various architectures and datasets, providing efficient AI models for deployment in resource-limited settings.
