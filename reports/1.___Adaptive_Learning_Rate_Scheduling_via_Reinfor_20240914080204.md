# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Reinfor

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Reinforcement Learning**: Develop a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training. This system would learn the optimal learning rate schedule by interacting with the training process, potentially reducing training time and improving model convergence with less computational overhead.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning-based algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during the training of machine learning models. This adaptive learning rate scheduler aims to reduce training time, improve model convergence, and minimize computational overhead compared to traditional learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
The methodology can be divided into several key steps:

1. **Reinforcement Learning Agent Design**:
   - Develop a reinforcement learning agent (e.g., using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)) that interacts with the training process of a machine learning model.
   - The agent's actions will be to adjust the learning rate at each training epoch or batch.

2. **State and Action Space**:
   - **State**: The state space will include metrics such as validation loss, training loss, gradient norms, and learning rates from previous epochs.
   - **Action**: The action space will involve choices of increasing, decreasing, or maintaining the current learning rate.

3. **Reward Function**:
   - Design a reward function that encourages faster convergence and better performance. For example, a reward can be inversely proportional to the validation loss and positively related to the reduction in training time.

4. **Integration with Training Loop**:
   - Integrate the RL agent into the training loop of the machine learning model. The agent will observe the state and adjust the learning rate accordingly at each step.

5. **Baseline Comparisons**:
   - Compare the performance of the RL-based learning rate scheduler with traditional learning rate schedules such as step decay, exponential decay, and cyclical learning rates.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used for training and evaluation:

1. **Image Classification**:
   - CIFAR-10: `dataset = datasets.load_dataset('cifar10')`

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - IMDB Movie Reviews for sentiment analysis: `dataset = datasets.load_dataset('imdb')`

3. **Tabular Data**:
   - UCI Adult Income: `dataset = datasets.load_dataset('uci_adult')`

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  ```python
  model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=False)
  ```

- **NLP**: Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism
  ```python
  model = nn.Sequential(
      nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim),
      nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True, bidirectional=True),
      AttentionMechanism(),
      nn.Linear(hidden_dim*2, output_dim)
  )
  ```

- **Tabular Data**: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
  ```python
  model = nn.Sequential(
      nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
      nn.ReLU(),
      nn.Linear(128, 64),
      nn.ReLU(),
      nn.Linear(64, output_dim)
  )
  ```

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**:
  - `learning_rate` = 0.001
  - `gamma` = 0.99 (discount factor)
  - `epsilon` = 0.1 (exploration rate)
  - `batch_size` = 32

- **Model Training**:
  - `initial_learning_rate` = 0.01
  - `optimizer` = Adam
  - `epochs` = 50
  - `batch_size` = 128

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Metrics**:
  - Training loss
  - Validation loss
  - Time to convergence (number of epochs to reach a specific validation loss threshold)

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy (for classification tasks)
  - F1-Score (for imbalanced classification tasks)
  - Mean Squared Error (for regression tasks)

- **Efficiency Metrics**:
  - Computational overhead (measured in additional time required by the RL agent)
  - Total training time (including time taken for RL agent decisions and model training)

The experiment will be conducted by running multiple trials with different seeds to ensure robustness and statistical significance of the results. The performance of the RL-based learning rate scheduler will be compared against traditional baselines to validate its effectiveness.
