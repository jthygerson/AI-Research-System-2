# Experiment Report: **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**:

## Idea
**Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implement a meta-learning approach that learns an efficient strategy for hyperparameter optimization across different models and datasets. This could involve leveraging past training experiences to quickly identify optimal hyperparameters for new tasks.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning approach to hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, we aim to determine whether leveraging past training experiences can lead to faster and more accurate identification of optimal hyperparameters across different models and datasets.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Meta-Learning Framework**: Implement a meta-learning framework that learns from past hyperparameter optimization trials. The framework will involve a meta-learner model trained to predict optimal hyperparameters based on dataset characteristics and initial model performance.

2. **Data Collection**: Collect historical data on hyperparameter optimization trials from a variety of models and datasets. This data will include hyperparameters, model architectures, dataset features, and performance metrics.

3. **Training the Meta-Learner**:
   - Input: Dataset features (e.g., number of samples, number of features), model architecture, and initial performance metrics.
   - Output: Predicted optimal hyperparameters.

4. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance of models trained with hyperparameters suggested by the meta-learner against those obtained through traditional hyperparameter optimization methods like Random Search and Bayesian Optimization.

5. **Experimental Setup**: Perform experiments on a range of models and datasets, splitting the data into training (for the meta-learner) and testing (for evaluation) sets.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use a diverse set of datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- **Classification**: 
  - IMDB (sentiment analysis)
  - MNIST (digit classification)
  - CIFAR-10 (image classification)
- **Regression**: 
  - Boston Housing (predicting house prices)
  - Diabetes (predicting disease progression)
- **NLP**: 
  - AG News (news categorization)
  - SQuAD (question answering)

#### 4. Model Architecture
We will use a variety of model types for this experiment:
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data (e.g., ResNet, VGG)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers for text data (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
- **Traditional ML Models**:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
We will focus on the following hyperparameters, which are commonly tuned across different models:
- **CNNs**:
  - Learning Rate: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
  - Batch Size: [16, 32, 64]
  - Number of Layers: [2, 4, 6]
  - Number of Filters: [32, 64, 128]
- **RNNs/Transformers**:
  - Learning Rate: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
  - Batch Size: [16, 32, 64]
  - Number of Layers: [2, 4, 6]
  - Hidden Units: [128, 256, 512]
- **Random Forest**:
  - Number of Trees: [50, 100, 200]
  - Max Depth: [10, 20, None]
  - Min Samples Split: [2, 5, 10]
- **GBM**:
  - Learning Rate: [0.01, 0.1, 0.2]
  - Number of Estimators: [100, 200, 300]
  - Max Depth: [3, 5, 7]

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
We will evaluate the performance of the meta-learning approach using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy** (for classification tasks)
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** (for regression tasks)
- **F1 Score** (for imbalanced classification tasks)
- **Training Time**: Time taken to reach the optimal hyperparameters.
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of iterations required to reach near-optimal performance.
- **Generalization**: Performance of the model on a hold-out test set.

By systematically following this plan, we aim to determine the efficacy of a meta-learning approach to hyperparameter optimization and its potential benefits over traditional methods.
