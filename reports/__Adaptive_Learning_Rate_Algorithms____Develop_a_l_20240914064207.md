## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Algorithms for Improved AI Research System Performance

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a lightweight, adaptive learning rate algorithm that dynamically adjusts based on the gradient variance observed during training. This algorithm aims to enhance convergence speed and overall model performance while minimizing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Design an adaptive learning rate algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the variance of gradients during training. This can be framed as an extension or modification of existing algorithms like AdaGrad, RMSprop, or Adam.
   - Implement the algorithm in a machine learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

2. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Train models using standard learning rate algorithms like SGD, AdaGrad, RMSprop, and Adam.
   - Train models using the newly developed adaptive learning rate algorithm.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - For each model, perform multiple training runs to account for variability in training due to random initialization.
   - Track and log training loss, validation loss, and other relevant metrics at regular intervals.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Compare the convergence speed and final model performance of the adaptive learning rate algorithm against the baseline algorithms.
   - Perform statistical analysis to determine if the differences observed are significant.

#### 3. Datasets
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digit classification dataset.
- **CIFAR-10**: Object recognition dataset containing 10 different classes.
- **IMDB**: Sentiment analysis dataset for binary classification.
- **SQuAD**: Question answering dataset for natural language processing tasks.

These datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets and cover a range of tasks including image classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **MNIST**: Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 2 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.
- **CIFAR-10**: Deeper CNN such as ResNet-18.
- **IMDB**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM cells.
- **SQuAD**: Transformer-based model like BERT.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.001 (for baseline algorithms)
- **Adaptive Learning Rate Parameters**:
  - **Gradient Variance Smoothing Factor**: 0.9
  - **Learning Rate Scaling Factor**: 0.1
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam (for baseline) and the new adaptive algorithm
- **Weight Decay**: 0.0001
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.5 (for applicable models)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Loss**: Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
- **Validation Loss**: Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified examples for classification tasks.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly for the IMDB and SQuAD datasets.
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs or time to reach a specified validation loss or accuracy threshold.
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Degree of performance variation with changes in hyperparameters.

By following this detailed experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the efficacy of the proposed adaptive learning rate algorithm and determine its impact on model training dynamics and performance.
