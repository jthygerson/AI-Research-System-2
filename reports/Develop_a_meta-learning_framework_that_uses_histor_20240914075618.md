# Experiment Report: Develop a meta-learning framework that uses histor

## Idea
Develop a meta-learning framework that uses historical hyperparameter tuning data from various models and datasets to guide the Bayesian optimization process for new models, reducing the number of required evaluations and computational resources.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning Framework for Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning

#### 1. Objective:
To design and evaluate a meta-learning framework that leverages historical hyperparameter tuning data to guide the Bayesian optimization process for new models. The goal is to reduce the number of required evaluations and computational resources while maintaining or improving model performance.

#### 2. Methodology:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather historical hyperparameter tuning data from a diverse set of machine learning models and datasets.
   - Store this data in a structured format (e.g., key-value pairs) for easy access and analysis.

2. **Meta-Learning Framework Development**:
   - Develop a meta-learning model that can learn from historical hyperparameter tuning data.
   - Integrate this meta-learning model with the Bayesian optimization process to guide the selection of hyperparameters for new models.

3. **Experiment Setup**:
   - Select a set of models and datasets for testing.
   - Split the selected datasets into training and validation sets.
   - For each model, perform hyperparameter tuning using both the traditional Bayesian optimization process and the meta-learning guided Bayesian optimization process.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of models tuned using the traditional Bayesian optimization process with those tuned using the meta-learning guided process.
   - Measure the number of evaluations and computational resources required for each method.
   - Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of the meta-learning framework.

#### 3. Datasets:
- **Dataset 1**: IMDb (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Dataset 2**: MNIST (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Dataset 3**: CIFAR-10 (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Dataset 4**: AG News (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Dataset 5**: SST-2 (available on Hugging Face Datasets)

#### 4. Model Architecture:
- **Model 1**: BERT-based text classifier
- **Model 2**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification
- **Model 3**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for text classification
- **Model 4**: ResNet for image classification
- **Model 5**: Transformer-based text classifier

#### 5. Hyperparameters:
- **Learning Rate**: {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1}
- **Batch Size**: {16, 32, 64, 128}
- **Number of Layers**: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- **Dropout Rate**: {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}
- **Optimizer**: {Adam, SGD, RMSprop}
- **Number of Epochs**: {10, 20, 30, 40}

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of the models on the validation set.
- **Validation Loss**: Evaluate the loss on the validation set.
- **Number of Evaluations**: Count the number of hyperparameter evaluations required to reach the optimal model performance.
- **Computational Resources**: Measure the computational resources (e.g., CPU/GPU time) required for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Time to Convergence**: Record the time taken for the optimization process to converge to the best hyperparameters.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to validate the effectiveness of the meta-learning framework in reducing the computational resources and time required for hyperparameter tuning while maintaining or improving model performance.
