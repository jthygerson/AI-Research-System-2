# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Based on Model 

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Based on Model Performance Metrics**: Develop an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on real-time performance metrics such as loss or accuracy. This approach could help accelerate convergence and improve the final model performance without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Based on Model Performance Metrics

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on real-time performance metrics such as loss and accuracy. The goal is to improve the final model performance and accelerate convergence without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Algorithm Development**: Develop an adaptive learning rate algorithm that monitors performance metrics (e.g., training loss, validation loss, and accuracy) in real-time and adjusts the learning rate accordingly. The algorithm will be compared against traditional static learning rate schedules and commonly used dynamic schedules like StepLR and ReduceLROnPlateau.
  
- **Training Protocol**:
  1. Initialize the model with a base learning rate.
  2. Train the model and monitor performance metrics at regular intervals (e.g., every epoch or every N batches).
  3. Adjust the learning rate based on the observed performance metrics using the adaptive algorithm.
  4. Continue training until convergence or a predefined number of epochs.

- **Baseline Comparison**: Train models using traditional static learning rates and existing dynamic schedules as baselines.

- **Experiment Repeats**: Conduct multiple runs to ensure statistical significance.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
- **Hugging Face Datasets**:
  - **CIFAR-10**: `datasets.load_dataset("cifar10")`
  - **IMDB**: `datasets.load_dataset("imdb")`

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**: ResNet-18
- **Text Classification (IMDB)**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: `0.001`
- **Batch Size**: `64`
- **Epochs**: `50`
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Adaptive Algorithm Parameters**:
  - **Metric Monitoring Interval**: `1 epoch`
  - **Learning Rate Adjustment Factor**: `0.1`
  - **Improvement Threshold**: `0.01` (for loss or accuracy)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary Metrics**:
  - **Training Loss**: Evaluated at the end of each epoch.
  - **Validation Loss**: Evaluated at the end of each epoch.
  - **Validation Accuracy**: Evaluated at the end of each epoch.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - **Training Time**: Total time taken to train the model.
  - **Convergence Epoch**: Number of epochs taken to reach a performance plateau.

The evaluation will compare the performance of the adaptive learning rate schedule against static and other dynamic schedules in terms of both primary and secondary metrics. The adaptive learning rate algorithm's ability to generalize across different datasets and model architectures will also be assessed.
