# Experiment Plan: Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning Using Meta-Learning 

## 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive hyperparameter tuning using meta-learning on improving the performance of AI models. Specifically, we aim to determine if meta-learning techniques can automate the process of hyperparameter tuning, thereby achieving better model performance compared to traditional methods.

## 2. Methodology
### Overview
We will employ a meta-learning algorithm to adaptively tune the hyperparameters of a target model. The experiment will be conducted in two phases: meta-training and meta-testing.

1. **Meta-Training Phase**:
   - Train a meta-learner on a set of base tasks, each representing a different dataset or problem.
   - The meta-learner will learn to predict optimal hyperparameters for these tasks.

2. **Meta-Testing Phase**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the meta-learner on unseen tasks.
   - Compare the results with traditional hyperparameter tuning methods like grid search and random search.

### Steps
1. Select a set of diverse datasets for meta-training and meta-testing.
2. Define a target model architecture for each task.
3. Implement the meta-learning algorithm to predict hyperparameters.
4. Train the target model using predicted hyperparameters for both meta-learning and traditional tuning methods.
5. Evaluate and compare the model performances.
