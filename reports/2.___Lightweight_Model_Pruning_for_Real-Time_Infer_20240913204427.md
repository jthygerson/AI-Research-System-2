# Experiment Report: 2. **Lightweight Model Pruning for Real-Time Infer

## Idea
2. **Lightweight Model Pruning for Real-Time Inference**: Create a pruning technique that iteratively removes redundant neurons and connections from neural networks without compromising accuracy. The method should be designed to run efficiently on a single GPU, aiming to accelerate inference times and reduce memory usage.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan for Lightweight Model Pruning for Real-Time Inference

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and validate a lightweight pruning technique that iteratively removes redundant neurons and connections from neural networks. The goal is to accelerate inference times and reduce memory usage without compromising the model's accuracy. The technique should be efficient enough to run on a single GPU, enabling its application in real-time scenarios.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Model Training**: Train a baseline model on the chosen dataset to establish a performance benchmark.
2. **Pruning Strategy Development**: Develop a pruning algorithm that:
   - Identifies redundant neurons and connections based on their contribution to the overall model performance.
   - Iteratively removes these redundant components while monitoring performance metrics.
3. **Pruning Implementation**: Apply the pruning algorithm to the trained model, ensuring that the process is efficient and can be executed on a single GPU.
4. **Fine-Tuning**: After pruning, fine-tune the pruned model to recover any potential loss in accuracy.
5. **Inference Testing**: Measure the inference time and memory usage of both the original and pruned models.
6. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the pruned model against the baseline using the defined evaluation metrics.

#### 3. Datasets
The datasets used will be publicly available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
- **SQuAD 2.0**: A reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **CIFAR-10**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as ResNet-18.
- **IMDB**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer model such as BERT for sentiment analysis.
- **SQuAD 2.0**: Transformer model such as BERT or DistilBERT for question answering.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 (initial), adaptive based on performance.
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 50 (initial training), 20 (fine-tuning post-pruning)
- **Pruning Rate**: 0.1 (10% of neurons/connections per iteration)
- **Pruning Iterations**: 5
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.5 (for regularization)
- **Optimizer**: Adam

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Primary metric to ensure that pruning does not compromise model performance.
- **Inference Time**: Time taken to make predictions on the test set. Lower is better.
- **Memory Usage**: Amount of GPU memory utilized during inference. Lower is better.
- **Parameter Count**: Number of parameters before and after pruning.
- **F1 Score**: For binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
- **Exact Match (EM)**: For question answering tasks to measure the percentage of predictions that match the ground truth exactly.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For any regression-based tasks.

By systematically following this experiment plan, we can validate the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight model pruning technique in enhancing real-time inference performance while maintaining model accuracy.
