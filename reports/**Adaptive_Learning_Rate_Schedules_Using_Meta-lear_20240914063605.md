# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Using Meta-lear

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Using Meta-learning**: Develop a lightweight meta-learning algorithm to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training. The algorithm could be trained to predict the optimal learning rate based on the loss landscape and gradient norms at each step, thereby improving convergence speed and overall model performance without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during the training of machine learning models. The key aim is to improve convergence speed and overall model performance by predicting the optimal learning rate based on the loss landscape and gradient norms at each step. This adaptive learning rate schedule is expected to reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Design and Implementation of Meta-Learning Algorithm:**
   - Develop a lightweight meta-learning algorithm that can be integrated with existing training pipelines.
   - The meta-learner will be a neural network that takes as input the current loss, gradient norms, and potentially other relevant features (e.g., past learning rates), and outputs the optimal learning rate for the next training step.

2. **Training Procedure:**
   - Two phases: 
     - **Meta-training:** Train the meta-learner on a variety of tasks/models to learn the relationship between the loss landscape, gradient norms, and the optimal learning rate.
     - **Task-specific Training:** Use the trained meta-learner to adjust the learning rate dynamically for different tasks/models.
   
3. **Baseline Comparison:**
   - Compare the proposed adaptive learning rate schedule with standard learning rate schedules such as constant, step decay, and cosine annealing.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Integrate the meta-learner with a popular deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).
   - Train and evaluate on multiple datasets and models to ensure generalizability.
