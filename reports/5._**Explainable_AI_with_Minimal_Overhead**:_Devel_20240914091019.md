# Experiment Report: 5. **Explainable AI with Minimal Overhead**: Devel

## Idea
5. **Explainable AI with Minimal Overhead**: Develop a novel approach to incorporate explainability into AI models with minimal computational overhead. The approach should focus on creating interpretable models that can provide insights into their decision-making processes without significantly impacting their performance or requiring extensive additional resources.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Explainable AI with Minimal Overhead

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a novel approach to incorporating explainability into AI models with minimal computational overhead. The goal is to create interpretable models that can provide insights into their decision-making processes without significantly impacting their performance or requiring extensive additional resources. The experiment will compare the performance and interpretability of traditional black-box models with the proposed explainable models.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Model Development**:
   - Develop a baseline model using a standard, high-performance ML algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Develop an explainable model using a novel approach that aims to minimize computational overhead. This could involve techniques such as:
     - Post-hoc explainability methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME).
     - Intrinsically interpretable models (e.g., decision trees, rule-based models).
     - Hybrid models that combine high-performance and interpretable components.
   
2. **Training and Validation**:
   - Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.
   - Train both the baseline and explainable models on the training set.
   - Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters and select the best model configurations.

3. **Explainability Evaluation**:
   - Apply explainability techniques to the trained models.
   - Evaluate the interpretability of the models by measuring the clarity and usefulness of the explanations provided.

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of the baseline and explainable models using standard evaluation metrics.
   - Measure the computational overhead introduced by the explainability techniques.
