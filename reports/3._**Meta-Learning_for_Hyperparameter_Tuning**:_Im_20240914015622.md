## Idea
3. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement a meta-learning framework that leverages past training runs to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks. This framework should use a simple neural network or a regression model to learn the relationship between task characteristics and hyperparameters, minimizing the need for extensive grid searches.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to test the efficacy of a meta-learning framework designed to predict optimal hyperparameters for new machine learning tasks. By leveraging data from past training runs, we aim to minimize the need for extensive and computationally expensive grid searches, thus improving the efficiency of the AI research process.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Collect data from previous training runs, including task characteristics, hyperparameters used, and resulting performance metrics.
   
2. **Task Feature Extraction**:
   - Define a set of features that describe each task. These features could include dataset size, number of features, data distribution characteristics, etc.

3. **Meta-Model Training**:
   - Train a simple neural network or regression model to learn the relationship between task characteristics and optimal hyperparameters.
   
4. **Hyperparameter Prediction**:
   - Use the trained meta-model to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks.
   
5. **Performance Validation**:
   - Compare the performance of models trained with hyperparameters predicted by the meta-model against those obtained through traditional grid search.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use a variety of datasets from Hugging Face Datasets to ensure diversity and generalizability of our meta-model. Example datasets include:
   - **GLUE Benchmark** for NLP tasks.
   - **CIFAR-10** for image classification tasks.
   - **UCI Machine Learning Repository** datasets for tabular data tasks.
   - **SQuAD** for question answering tasks.

#### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Meta-Model**:
   - **Type**: Simple Feedforward Neural Network or Linear Regression Model.
   - **Layers**: 3 layers (Input Layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer).
   - **Activation Functions**: ReLU for hidden layers, Linear for output layer.
   
2. **Task Models**:
   - **NLP**: BERT-based model.
   - **Image Classification**: ResNet-50.
   - **Tabular Data**: XGBoost.
   - **Question Answering**: DistilBERT.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters to be tuned and predicted include:
   - **Learning Rate**: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1
   - **Batch Size**: 16, 32, 64
   - **Number of Epochs**: 10, 20, 30
   - **Optimizer**: Adam, SGD
   - **Dropout Rate**: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the meta-learning framework, we will use the following metrics:
   - **Prediction Accuracy of Hyperparameters**: Measure how often the predicted hyperparameters are close to the optimal ones found via grid search.
   - **Model Performance**: Compare the accuracy, F1 score, or other relevant metrics of models trained with predicted hyperparameters against those trained with hyperparameters from grid search.
   - **Computational Efficiency**: Measure the time and computational resources saved by using the meta-learning framework compared to grid search.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to validate the hypothesis that a meta-learning framework can effectively predict optimal hyperparameters, leading to improved efficiency and performance in various AI/ML tasks.
