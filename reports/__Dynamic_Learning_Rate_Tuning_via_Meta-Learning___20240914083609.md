# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Learning Rate Tuning via Meta-Learning**

## Idea
**Dynamic Learning Rate Tuning via Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training. This algorithm should use a small meta-dataset to learn optimal learning rate schedules based on the current state of the model and its training progress. This could be tested on standard datasets like CIFAR-10 using a single GPU within a week.

## Experiment Plan
# Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Tuning via Meta-Learning

## 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and assess the efficacy of a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training. The hypothesis is that the meta-learning algorithm can learn optimal learning rate schedules based on the current state of the model and its training progress, thereby enhancing the model's performance and convergence speed.

## 2. Methodology
### Meta-Learning Algorithm Development
1. **Meta-Dataset Creation**: 
   - Generate a small meta-dataset that includes various model states and their corresponding optimal learning rates.
   - This will be done by running preliminary training sessions with different learning rate schedules and recording model performance metrics.

2. **Meta-Learner Training**:
   - Develop a meta-learner, which could be a simple neural network or a more sophisticated model like LSTM, to predict optimal learning rates.
   - Train the meta-learner on the meta-dataset to learn the mapping between model states and optimal learning rates.

### Model Training with Dynamic Learning Rate Tuning
1. **Baseline Model Training**:
   - Train a baseline neural network model on CIFAR-10 using standard, fixed learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, cosine annealing).
   - Record performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and training time.

2. **Dynamic Learning Rate Model Training**:
   - Integrate the trained meta-learner into the training loop of the same neural network model.
   - During each training epoch, use the meta-learner to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the current model state.
   - Record the same performance metrics for comparison.

### Comparison and Analysis
- Compare the performance of the baseline model and the dynamically tuned model using standard evaluation metrics.
- Analyze the benefits and potential drawbacks of the dynamic learning rate tuning approach.

## 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A standard dataset for image classification tasks, available on Hugging Face Datasets (`"cifar10"`).
- **Meta-Dataset**: Derived from preliminary training sessions on CIFAR-10.

## 4. Model Architecture
- **Baseline Model**: ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network commonly used for image classification tasks.
- **Meta-Learner**: A simple feedforward neural network or LSTM to predict learning rates based on model states.

## 5. Hyperparameters
- **Baseline Model Training**:
  - `learning_rate`: 0.01
  - `batch_size`: 128
  - `epochs`: 100
  - `optimizer`: SGD with momentum 0.9
- **Meta-Learner Training**:
  - `meta_learning_rate`: 0.001
  - `meta_batch_size`: 32
  - `meta_epochs`: 50
  - `meta_optimizer`: Adam
- **Dynamic Learning Rate Model Training**:
  - `initial_learning_rate`: 0.01
  - `meta_update_interval`: Every epoch
  - `meta_loss_weight`: 0.1 (weighting factor for loss from meta-learner predictions)

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified images on the test set.
- **Loss**: Cross-entropy loss on the test set.
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to complete the training process.
- **Learning Rate Schedule Efficiency**: Measure of how well the learning rate schedule adapts to the training process, potentially via a custom metric like the variance of learning rates over epochs.

This experimental plan aims to provide a structured approach to evaluate the impact of dynamic learning rate tuning via meta-learning on the performance of neural networks, specifically in the context of image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
