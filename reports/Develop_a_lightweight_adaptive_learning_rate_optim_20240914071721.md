# Experiment Report: Develop a lightweight adaptive learning rate optim

## Idea
Develop a lightweight adaptive learning rate optimizer that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the gradient variance and loss landscape in real-time. This would reduce training times and improve convergence rates without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Testing a Lightweight Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizer

#### 1. Objective
The primary goal of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed lightweight adaptive learning rate optimizer. The optimizer aims to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the gradient variance and loss landscape in real-time, thereby reducing training times and improving convergence rates without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Optimizer Development**: 
   - Implement the lightweight adaptive learning rate optimizer that adjusts learning rates in real-time based on gradient variance and the loss landscape.

2. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Compare the new optimizer against standard optimizers like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop.

3. **Experimental Setup**:
   - Train multiple machine learning models using both the new optimizer and standard optimizers.
   - Track training time, convergence rates, and final model performance.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform statistical tests to determine if differences in performance metrics are significant.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A large movie review dataset for sentiment classification.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: A reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles.

These datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: 
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with architecture similar to VGG16 for CIFAR-10.
  - Simple CNN for MNIST.

- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism for IMDB.

- **Question Answering**:
  - BERT-based transformer model for SQuAD.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Although the new optimizer aims to reduce hyperparameter tuning, initial values are necessary for a fair comparison:
- **Learning Rate**: Initially set to 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 20 for CIFAR-10 and IMDB, 10 for MNIST, 3 for SQuAD (due to computational intensity)
- **Momentum (for SGD)**: 0.9
- **Beta1, Beta2 (for Adam)**: 0.9, 0.999
- **Epsilon (for Adam and RMSprop)**: 1e-8
- **Weight Decay**: 0 (to isolate the effect of learning rate adaptation)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to complete training.
- **Convergence Rate**: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined performance threshold.
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: Accuracy on the validation set after completing training.
- **Final Validation Loss**: Loss on the validation set after completing training.
- **Learning Rate Stability**: Variance of the learning rate throughout the training process.
- **Statistical Significance**: p-values from statistical tests comparing performance metrics of the new optimizer against standard ones.

By conducting this experiment, we aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed optimizer's effectiveness relative to established methods, focusing on both speed and quality of convergence.
