### Experiment Plan: Transfer Learning with Minimal Data

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a transfer learning framework that enables pre-trained models to be effectively fine-tuned on small datasets using limited computational resources. This research will explore innovative data augmentation methods and regularization techniques to enhance generalization performance.
