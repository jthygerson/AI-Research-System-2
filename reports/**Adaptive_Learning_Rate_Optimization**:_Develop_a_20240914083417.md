## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate for different layers of a neural network during training. This could involve using a reinforcement learning agent to monitor training progress and make real-time adjustments, thereby improving convergence rates and overall model performance.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate for different layers of a neural network in real-time. By employing a reinforcement learning agent to monitor the training progress and adjust the learning rates, we aim to improve convergence rates and overall model performance.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Baseline Model**: Train a neural network using a fixed learning rate for comparison.
2. **Meta-Learning Algorithm**:
   - Develop a reinforcement learning agent (RLA) tasked with adjusting the learning rates.
   - The RLA will observe the gradients, loss, and other relevant metrics of each layer during training.
   - Based on these observations, the RLA will dynamically adjust the learning rates for each layer.
3. **Training Loop**:
   - Split the training data into mini-batches.
   - For each mini-batch, update the neural network weights using the current learning rates.
   - Use the reinforcement learning agent to adjust the learning rates based on the observed metrics.
   - Repeat until the training converges.
4. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the performance of the baseline model and the model using the adaptive learning rate optimization.
5. **Reproducibility**:
   - Ensure the experiment is reproducible by fixing random seeds and documenting the environment settings.

#### 3. Datasets
The experiment will use the following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
1. **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`hf-cifar10`)
2. **Natural Language Processing**: IMDB Movie Reviews (`imdb`)
3. **Tabular Data**: Titanic Dataset (`titanic`)

1. **Image Classification**:
   - **Model**: ResNet-18
