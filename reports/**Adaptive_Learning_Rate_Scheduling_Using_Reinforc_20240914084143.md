### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling Using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to test whether an adaptive learning rate scheduling mechanism based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) can improve the performance of AI models. Specifically, we aim to compare the performance of traditional learning rate schedules (like Step Decay and Exponential Decay) with an RL-based adaptive learning rate schedule. The hypothesis is that RL can dynamically adjust the learning rate more effectively to achieve better performance and faster convergence.

#### 2. Methodology
**Overview**:
1. Train three sets of models: one with a traditional Step Decay learning rate schedule, one with an Exponential Decay schedule, and one with an RL-based adaptive schedule.
2. Use a Reinforcement Learning agent to adjust the learning rate during training based on the modelâ€™s performance metrics such as loss and accuracy.
3. Compare the performance of all models using standardized evaluation metrics.

**Steps**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize three identical model architectures for each type of learning rate schedule.
   - Initialize the RL agent for adaptive learning rate control. The agent will be trained using a policy gradient method such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

2. **Training**:
   - For the traditional schedules, train the models using predefined learning rate schedules.
   - For the RL-based adaptive schedule, train the model while simultaneously training the RL agent to adjust the learning rate based on performance metrics.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models on a validation dataset after each epoch.
   - After training, compare the final performance of all models on the test dataset.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Training Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (Available on Hugging Face Datasets: `cifar10`)
- **Validation Dataset**: Split from the CIFAR-10 training set (10% of the training data)
- **Test Dataset**: CIFAR-10 test set

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: ResNet-18
  - **Input Layer**: 32x32 RGB images
  - **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, Batch Normalization, and MaxPooling.
  - **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers leading to a 10-class softmax output.
  - **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for classification.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
**Traditional Learning Rate Schedules**:
- `Step Decay`:
  - `initial_lr`: 0.01
  - `decay_rate`: 0.5
  - `decay_step`: 10 epochs
- `Exponential Decay`:
  - `initial_lr`: 0.01
  - `decay_rate`: 0.96
  - `decay_steps`: 1000 iterations

**RL-based Adaptive Schedule**:
- `initial_lr`: 0.01
- `rl_agent`:
  - `policy_network_architecture`: [128, 64] (Two hidden layers with 128 and 64 neurons respectively)
  - `learning_rate`: 0.0003
  - `discount_factor`: 0.99
  - `epsilon`: 0.1 (for exploration-exploitation trade-off)

**General Hyperparameters**:
- `batch_size`: 64
- `epochs`: 50
- `optimizer`: SGD with momentum 0.9
- `loss_function`: Cross-Entropy Loss

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified images in the test set.
- **Loss**: Cross-Entropy loss on the test set.
- **Convergence Rate**: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold.
- **Learning Rate Trend**: Analysis of how the learning rate changes over epochs in the RL-based schedule.

**Additional Analysis**:
- **Training Time**: Total time taken for training.
- **Stability**: Variance in the performance across multiple runs.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate scheduling using reinforcement learning compared to traditional learning rate schedules.
