# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop a

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop a lightweight adaptive learning rate algorithm that dynamically adjusts based on the model's performance metrics (e.g., validation loss) in real-time. The goal is to improve convergence speed and final model accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a lightweight adaptive learning rate algorithm that adjusts dynamically based on real-time model performance metrics, such as validation loss. The aim is to improve both the convergence speed and final model accuracy while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Algorithm Development**: Develop an adaptive learning rate algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the validation loss observed during training. This algorithm will be compared against traditional learning rate schedules like fixed, step decay, and cosine annealing.
  
- **Baseline Comparison**: Implement and train models with standard learning rate schedules to serve as baselines.
  
- **Training Procedure**: Train models using both the adaptive learning rate algorithm and baseline algorithms on the selected datasets. Track performance metrics such as training loss, validation loss, convergence speed, and final accuracy.
  
- **Analysis**: Compare the performance of the adaptive learning rate algorithm against the baselines in terms of both convergence speed and final model accuracy. Assess computational overhead by measuring training time and resource usage.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, available on Hugging Face Datasets (`huggingface/cifar10`).
- **IMDB Reviews**: A text classification dataset for sentiment analysis, available on Hugging Face Datasets (`huggingface/imdb`).
- **LibriSpeech**: A large-scale dataset for speech recognition, available on Hugging Face Datasets (`huggingface/librispeech`).

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10.
- **Text Classification**: BERT-base for IMDB Reviews.
- **Speech Recognition**: Wav2Vec 2.0 for LibriSpeech.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Common Hyperparameters**:
  - `batch_size`: 32
  - `optimizer`: Adam
  - `initial_learning_rate`: 0.001
  - `epochs`: 50
  - `validation_split`: 0.2
  - `early_stopping_patience`: 10

- **Adaptive Learning Rate Specific Hyperparameters**:
  - `adjustment_factor`: 0.1 (multiplier to adjust learning rate)
  - `performance_metric_threshold`: 0.01 (threshold for detecting significant performance change)
  - `min_learning_rate`: 1e-6 (minimum learning rate to prevent it from becoming too small)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Loss**: Monitored during the training process to assess model convergence.
- **Validation Loss**: Used to dynamically adjust the learning rate and evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- **Accuracy**: Final model accuracy on the validation set for classification tasks (CIFAR-10, IMDB Reviews).
- **WER (Word Error Rate)**: Final model performance metric for speech recognition (LibriSpeech).
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs taken to reach a pre-defined validation loss threshold.
- **Computational Overhead**: Measured in terms of total training time and resource usage (CPU/GPU utilization).

By following this detailed experiment plan, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm can be systematically assessed and compared against traditional learning rate schedules.
