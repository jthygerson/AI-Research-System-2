# Experiment Report: 4. **Pruning and Quantization During Training**: D

## Idea
4. **Pruning and Quantization During Training**: Develop a method that combines model pruning and quantization techniques during the training phase itself, rather than as a post-training optimization. This can lead to more efficient models that require less memory and computational power without significantly sacrificing accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Pruning and Quantization During Training

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a method that integrates model pruning and quantization techniques during the training phase of deep learning models. The goal is to create more efficient models that require less memory and computational power while maintaining comparable accuracy to traditionally trained models.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Baseline Model Training**: Train a baseline model without pruning or quantization to establish a performance benchmark.
2. **Integrated Pruning and Quantization Training**: Develop a custom training loop that incorporates both pruning and quantization during the training process.
   - **Pruning**: Gradually remove less significant weights based on their magnitude or contribution to the loss function.
   - **Quantization**: Apply dynamic quantization to weights and activations during training.
3. **Training Procedure**: 
   - Initialize a model with standard weights.
   - At predefined intervals (e.g., after every epoch), apply pruning to remove a fraction of the least significant weights.
   - Apply quantization to the pruned model weights and activations before the next training iteration.
   - Continue training the pruned and quantized model.
4. **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare the performance of the baseline model and the pruned-quantized model in terms of accuracy, memory usage, and computational efficiency.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `huggingface/cifar10`)
- **Text Classification**: IMDB Movie Reviews (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `huggingface/imdb`)
- **Speech Recognition**: LibriSpeech (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `huggingface/librispeech_asr`)

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-18
- **Text Classification**: BERT-base
- **Speech Recognition**: Wav2Vec 2.0

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Common Hyperparameters**:
  - `learning_rate`: 0.001
  - `batch_size`: 32
  - `epochs`: 50
  - `optimizer`: Adam
  - `initial_weight_prune_fraction`: 0.1 (10% of weights pruned initially)
  - `pruning_interval`: Every 5 epochs
  - `quantization_bits`: 8 (for both weights and activations)
  - `pruning_method`: Magnitude-based
  - `quantization_method`: Dynamic quantization

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure the top-1 and top-5 accuracy for classification tasks.
- **Memory Usage**: Measure the memory footprint of the model during training and inference.
- **Inference Time**: Measure the time taken for a single forward pass during inference.
- **Model Size**: Measure the size of the model (in MB) on disk.
- **Training Time**: Measure the total training time for convergence.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to determine whether integrating pruning and quantization during training can produce models that are both efficient and accurate. This method could potentially lead to improvements in the deployment of AI models, especially in resource-constrained environments.
