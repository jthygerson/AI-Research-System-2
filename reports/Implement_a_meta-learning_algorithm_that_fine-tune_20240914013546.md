# Experiment Report: Implement a meta-learning algorithm that fine-tune

## Idea
Implement a meta-learning algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained models more efficiently by learning from past fine-tuning experiences. This method should reduce the time and computational resources required for fine-tuning tasks, making it ideal for limited resource environments.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning Algorithm for Efficient Fine-Tuning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning algorithm designed to fine-tune pre-trained models more efficiently. By leveraging past fine-tuning experiences, the meta-learning algorithm aims to reduce both the time and computational resources required for fine-tuning tasks. This will be particularly beneficial for environments with limited computational resources.

   - **Meta-Testing Phase**: Evaluate the meta-learning algorithm on unseen tasks to test its generalization ability.
5. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of the meta-learning algorithm with traditional fine-tuning methods.
6. **Resource Measurement**: Measure the time and computational resources used during fine-tuning.
7. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests to validate the significance of the results.

### File: model.py
**Original Code:**
```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class EnhancedModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(EnhancedModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)  # Added dropout for regularization
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(torch.relu(self.fc2(x)))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc3(x))
        x = self.fc4(x)
        return x

model = EnhancedModel()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)  # Changed optimizer to Adam and adjusted learning rate
