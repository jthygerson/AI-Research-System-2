## Idea
4. **Lightweight Attention Mechanisms**: Design and test new lightweight attention mechanisms that can be integrated into existing neural network architectures to improve performance on tasks like natural language processing and computer vision. The goal is to achieve similar or better performance compared to traditional attention mechanisms but with reduced computational requirements.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Lightweight Attention Mechanisms in AI/ML

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to design and test new lightweight attention mechanisms that can be integrated into existing neural network architectures. The goal is to achieve similar or better performance compared to traditional attention mechanisms but with reduced computational requirements. This will be evaluated on tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Design Lightweight Attention Mechanisms**:
   - Develop novel lightweight attention mechanisms by simplifying the traditional attention mechanisms, such as reducing the number of parameters or computational steps.
   - Implement these mechanisms in PyTorch or TensorFlow.

2. **Integration into Existing Architectures**:
   - Integrate the new lightweight attention mechanisms into popular neural network architectures for NLP (e.g., Transformer, BERT) and CV (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformer).

3. **Experimental Setup**:
   - Split the datasets into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train the models with both traditional and lightweight attention mechanisms.
   - Compare performance in terms of accuracy, computational requirements, and memory usage.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Fine-tune the hyperparameters for both traditional and lightweight attention mechanisms to ensure fair comparison.
