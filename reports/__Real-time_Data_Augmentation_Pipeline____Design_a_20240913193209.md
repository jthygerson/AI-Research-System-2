# Experiment Report: **Real-time Data Augmentation Pipeline**: Design a

## Idea
**Real-time Data Augmentation Pipeline**: Design a real-time data augmentation pipeline that dynamically adjusts augmentation strategies based on the model's learning progress. The goal is to maintain a balance between introducing variability and preserving computational efficiency during training.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
To design and evaluate a real-time data augmentation pipeline that dynamically adjusts augmentation strategies based on the model's learning progress. The primary goal is to maintain a balance between introducing variability and preserving computational efficiency during training, ultimately improving the model's performance and generalization capability.

### 2. Methodology
**a. Baseline Training:**
- Train a baseline model without any dynamic augmentation to establish a performance benchmark.

**b. Real-time Augmentation Pipeline:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - Start training with a predefined set of basic augmentations (e.g., horizontal flip, random crop).
   - Monitor the model's learning progress using validation loss or accuracy.
   
2. **Dynamic Adjustment:**
   - Periodically evaluate the model's performance (e.g., every epoch or every N batches).
   - Based on the performance indicators:
     - **If the validation loss decreases steadily:** Gradually increase augmentation complexity (e.g., adding rotations, color jittering).
     - **If the validation loss stagnates or increases:** Reduce augmentation complexity to allow the model to stabilize.
   - Implement a feedback loop where the augmentation strategy is adjusted in real-time based on the model's learning curve.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Compare the performance of the dynamically adjusted augmentation pipeline with the baseline model.

### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10:** A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **MNIST:** A dataset of handwritten digits, also available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **IMDB:** A dataset for binary sentiment classification, available on Hugging Face Datasets.

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification:** ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
- **Text Classification:** BERT base model for IMDB sentiment analysis.

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001 (initial)
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Initial Augmentation Strategies:** {'horizontal_flip': True, 'random_crop': True}
- **Dynamic Adjustment Interval:** Every epoch or every 500 batches
- **Augmentation Complexity Increase:** {'rotation': 15 degrees, 'color_jitter': {'brightness': 0.1, 'contrast': 0.1}}
- **Augmentation Complexity Decrease:** {'rotation': 0 degrees, 'color_jitter': None}

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Image Classification:**
  - **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified images in the test set.
  - **Validation Loss:** Cross-entropy loss on the validation set.
  - **Training Time:** Total time taken to train the model.
- **Text Classification:**
  - **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified reviews in the test set.
  - **Validation Loss:** Cross-entropy loss on the validation set.
  - **Training Time:** Total time taken to train the model.

### Experiment Execution Plan
1. **Baseline Training:**
   - Train the ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-10 and MNIST without dynamic augmentation.
   - Train the BERT model on IMDB without dynamic augmentation.
   - Record the performance metrics (accuracy, validation loss, training time).

2. **Dynamic Augmentation Pipeline:**
   - Implement the real-time data augmentation pipeline.
   - Train the ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-10 and MNIST with dynamic augmentation.
   - Train the BERT model on IMDB with dynamic augmentation.
   - Record the performance metrics (accuracy, validation loss, training time).

3. **Comparison and Analysis:**
   - Compare the performance metrics between the baseline and dynamically augmented models.
   - Analyze the impact of real-time data augmentation on model performance and training efficiency.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to validate whether a real-time data augmentation pipeline can enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency.

**Original Code:**
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",     
    learning_rate=3e-5,              # Slightly increased learning rate for better convergence
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,  # Increased batch size to stabilize training
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,   
    num_train_epochs=3,              # Increased epochs to allow more learning
    weight_decay=0.01,
