## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Meta-Learning

### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the efficacy of Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Meta-Learning in improving the performance of AI models. Specifically, we aim to determine whether a meta-learning-based approach to dynamically adjusting the learning rate can outperform traditional learning rate schedules (e.g., step decay, cosine annealing) in terms of model accuracy, convergence speed, and overall stability.

### 2. Methodology
#### 2.1. Experiment Setup
- **Control Group**: Train models using traditional learning rate schedules.
- **Experimental Group**: Train models using an adaptive learning rate schedule derived via meta-learning.

#### 2.2. Meta-Learning Approach
- **Meta-Learner**: A neural network that predicts the optimal learning rate for each epoch based on the current state of the model (e.g., loss, gradient norms).
- **Training Phase**: Train the meta-learner on a variety of tasks to generalize learning rate adjustment strategies.
- **Deployment Phase**: Use the trained meta-learner to adjust the learning rate of the primary task model during training.

### 3. Datasets
We will use a diverse set of datasets to ensure the generalizability of our results. The datasets will be sourced from Hugging Face Datasets:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: 
  - **IMDB Reviews** (`imdb`)
  - **SQuAD v2.0** (`squad_v2`)
  
- **Computer Vision (CV)**:
  - **CIFAR-10** (`cifar10`)
  - **ImageNet** (`imagenet-1k`)

- **Tabular Data**:
  - **UCI Adult Income Dataset** (`adult`)

### 4. Model Architecture
#### 4.1. NLP Models
- **BERT** (`bert-base-uncased`)
- **GPT-2** (`gpt2`)

#### 4.2. CV Models
- **ResNet-50** (`resnet-50`)
- **EfficientNet** (`efficientnet-b0`)

#### 4.3. Tabular Models
- **XGBoost** (`xgboost`)
- **TabNet** (`tabnet`)

### 5. Hyperparameters
For each model, we will tune the following hyperparameters:

- **Learning Rate**: Initial learning rate (before any scheduling)
  - `lr_initial`: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples per gradient update
  - `batch_size`: 32
- **Epochs**: Number of training epochs
  - `epochs`: 50
- **Optimizer**: Optimization algorithm
  - `optimizer`: Adam
- **Meta-Learner Parameters**:
  - `meta_lr`: 0.01 (Learning rate for the meta-learner)
  - `meta_batch_size`: 16
  - `meta_epochs`: 10

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:

#### 6.1. Primary Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances (for classification tasks).
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall (for imbalanced datasets).
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression tasks.

#### 6.2. Secondary Metrics
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a certain accuracy threshold.
- **Stability**: Variance in accuracy across multiple runs.
- **Final Loss**: The final training loss after the last epoch.

### 6.3. Comparative Analysis
- **Improvement Percentage**: Percentage improvement in primary metrics when using adaptive learning rate scheduling compared to traditional schedules.
- **Statistical Significance**: Use paired t-tests to determine if the differences in performance metrics are statistically significant.

### 6.4. Ablation Studies
- **Meta-Learner Impact**: Compare performance with and without the meta-learner.
- **Learning Rate Sensitivity**: Evaluate how sensitive the models are to different initial learning rates.

This comprehensive experiment plan is designed to rigorously test the hypothesis that Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Meta-Learning can enhance the performance of AI/ML models across various domains and datasets.
