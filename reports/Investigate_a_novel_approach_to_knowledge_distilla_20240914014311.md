# Experiment Report: Investigate a novel approach to knowledge distilla

## Idea
Investigate a novel approach to knowledge distillation where a smaller student model is trained using the knowledge from a larger teacher model, but with a focus on minimizing the computational resources required. This approach could include selective layer distillation or reduced precision training.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Knowledge Distillation with Focus on Minimizing Computational Resources

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel knowledge distillation approach aimed at training a smaller student model using the knowledge from a larger teacher model. The focus is on minimizing computational resources through techniques such as selective layer distillation and reduced precision training. The ultimate goal is to maintain or improve the performance of the student model while significantly reducing the computational cost.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Teacher Model Training**: Train a large teacher model using standard training procedures.
2. **Selective Layer Distillation**:
   - Identify and select crucial layers from the teacher model that carry the most significant information.
   - Transfer knowledge from these layers to the corresponding layers in the student model.
3. **Reduced Precision Training**:
   - Utilize techniques like mixed precision training to reduce computational costs without significantly impacting model performance.
4. **Student Model Training**:
   - Train the student model using the distilled knowledge from the selected layers of the teacher model.
   - Implement reduced precision training during this phase.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance and computational costs of the student model against the teacher model and a baseline student model trained without these techniques.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10, available on Hugging Face Datasets (`cifar10`).
- **Natural Language Processing**: GLUE Benchmark, available on Hugging Face Datasets (`glue`).

#### 4. Model Architecture
