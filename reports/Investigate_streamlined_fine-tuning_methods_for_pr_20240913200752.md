## Experiment Plan
## Detailed Experiment Plan on Streamlined Fine-Tuning Methods

### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate streamlined fine-tuning methods for pre-trained models using minimal data and compute resources. The goal is to optimize the transfer learning process for low-resource environments by experimenting with various layer freezing techniques, learning rate schedules, and data augmentation strategies.

### 2. Methodology
The experiment will proceed through the following steps:
1. **Model Selection and Initialization**: Select pre-trained models from Hugging Faceâ€™s library.
2. **Layer Freezing Techniques**: Experiment with different layer freezing strategies (e.g., freezing early layers, freezing alternate layers).
3. **Learning Rate Schedules**: Apply various learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, cosine annealing, cyclical).
4. **Data Augmentation**: Implement data augmentation strategies suitable for the chosen datasets (e.g., text augmentation for NLP, image transformations for CV).
5. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the models using the selected strategies.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using predefined metrics.
7. **Analysis**: Analyze results to determine the optimal combination of techniques for low-resource environments.

### 3. Datasets
We will use datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- **NLP Task**: 'ag_news' for text classification
- **Computer Vision Task**: 'cifar10' for image classification

### 4. Model Architecture
- **NLP Model**: `bert-base-uncased` from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- **CV Model**: `resnet50` from the Hugging Face Models library.

### 5. Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters for each model will be as follows:

**NLP Model (BERT)**
- `learning_rate`: [1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5]
- `batch_size`: [16, 32]
- `epochs`: [3, 5]
- `layer_freezing`: ["none", "freeze_1st_half", "freeze_2nd_half", "alternate_freezing"]
- `learning_rate_schedule`: ["constant", "cosine_annealing", "cyclical"]
- `data_augmentation`: ["none", "synonym_replacement", "random_insertion"]

**CV Model (ResNet-50)**
- `learning_rate`: [1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2]
- `batch_size`: [32, 64]
- `epochs`: [10, 20]
- `layer_freezing`: ["none", "freeze_1st_half", "freeze_2nd_half", "alternate_freezing"]
- `learning_rate_schedule`: ["constant", "cosine_annealing", "cyclical"]
- `data_augmentation`: ["none", "random_crop", "horizontal_flip"]

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the fine-tuning strategies will be evaluated using the following metrics:

**For NLP (Text Classification)**
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall to account for class imbalance.
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to train the model.

**For CV (Image Classification)**
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified images.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall (useful for class imbalance).
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to train the model.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Load pre-trained models and datasets.
2. **Layer Freezing**: Implement techniques to freeze specified layers.
3. **Learning Rate Schedule**: Integrate different learning rate schedules.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques during training.
5. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune models using combinations of the above techniques.
6. **Evaluation**: Measure performance using accuracy, F1 score, and training time.
7. **Comparison**: Compare results across different settings to identify optimal strategies.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of streamlined fine-tuning methods, aiming to enhance the efficiency of AI models in low-resource environments.
