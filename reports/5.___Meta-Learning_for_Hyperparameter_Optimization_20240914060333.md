# Experiment Report: 5. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization

## Idea
5. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that quickly tunes hyperparameters for new tasks by leveraging past training experiences on similar tasks. This approach can significantly reduce the time and computational resources needed for hyperparameter optimization while maintaining or enhancing model performance.

## Experiment Plan
## 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and test a meta-learning algorithm for hyperparameter optimization that leverages past training experiences on similar tasks to quickly and efficiently tune hyperparameters for new tasks. The goal is to reduce the time and computational resources needed for hyperparameter optimization while maintaining or enhancing model performance.

## 2. Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. **Task Selection**: Select a diverse set of tasks from various domains (e.g., text classification, image classification, regression).
2. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the datasets for each task, ensuring uniformity in input formats and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

### Phase 2: Meta-Training
1. **Base Model Training**: Train base models on a variety of tasks using a range of hyperparameter settings.
2. **Meta-Feature Extraction**: Extract meta-features from each task (e.g., dataset size, average word length for text, image resolution).
3. **Meta-Model Training**: Train a meta-learning algorithm using the extracted meta-features and corresponding hyperparameter-performance pairs.

### Phase 3: Meta-Evaluation
1. **New Task Selection**: Select new, unseen tasks for hyperparameter optimization.
2. **Hyperparameter Suggestion**: Use the trained meta-learning algorithm to suggest hyperparameters for the new tasks.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train models on the new tasks using the suggested hyperparameters and evaluate their performance.

### Phase 4: Comparison and Analysis
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the meta-optimized models with baseline models that use traditional hyperparameter optimization techniques (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization).
2. **Resource Analysis**: Measure the time and computational resources required for hyperparameter optimization in both the meta-learning and baseline approaches.
3. **Performance Metrics Analysis**: Analyze the performance metrics to determine if the meta-learning approach maintains or enhances model performance.
