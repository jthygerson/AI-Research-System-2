# Experiment Report: **Sparse Matrix Representations for Efficient Trai

## Idea
**Sparse Matrix Representations for Efficient Training**: Explore the use of sparse matrix representations in neural network layers to reduce memory usage and computational load. Implementing and testing different sparsity patterns (e.g., block sparsity, random sparsity) on common architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers to evaluate the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Sparse Matrix Representations for Efficient Training

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of sparse matrix representations in reducing memory usage and computational load during the training of neural networks. We aim to identify the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model accuracy when employing different sparsity patterns (e.g., block sparsity, random sparsity) in common architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Baseline Model Training**
  - Train baseline models (CNN and Transformer) without any sparsity to establish a performance benchmark in terms of accuracy and computational resources.
  
- **Step 2: Implement Sparse Representations**
  - Introduce sparse matrix representations in the neural network layers, focusing on different sparsity patterns such as block sparsity and random sparsity.
  
- **Step 3: Train Sparse Models**
  - Train the modified sparse models using the same datasets and hyperparameters as the baseline models.
  
- **Step 4: Evaluate Performance**
  - Compare the performance of sparse models against the baseline models using predefined evaluation metrics.
  
- **Step 5: Analyze Trade-offs**
  - Analyze the trade-offs between computational efficiency (memory usage, training time) and model accuracy.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset for image classification. It contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing.
  
These datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- CIFAR-10: `huggingface/datasets/cifar10`
- IMDB: `huggingface/datasets/imdb`
