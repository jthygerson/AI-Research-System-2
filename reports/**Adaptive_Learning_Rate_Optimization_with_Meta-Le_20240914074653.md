# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization with Meta-Le

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization with Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning framework that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of an AI model during training. The system could use a secondary neural network to predict the optimal learning rate based on the current state of the primary model's training metrics, such as loss and gradient values.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning framework that can dynamically adjust the learning rate of an AI model during training. By leveraging a secondary neural network to predict the optimal learning rate based on the training metrics of the primary model, we aim to enhance the performance and convergence speed of the primary AI model.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Setup**: 
   - **Primary Model**: Train a primary AI model on a specific task.
   - **Secondary Model**: Develop a secondary neural network that will predict the optimal learning rate for the primary model based on the current state of training metrics.

2. **Training Phases**:
   - **Phase 1**: Train the primary model with a static learning rate to gather initial training metrics.
   - **Phase 2**: Use the collected metrics to train the secondary model to predict the optimal learning rate.
   - **Phase 3**: Implement the dynamic learning rate adjustment in the primary model using the secondary model's predictions and continue training the primary model.

3. **Feedback Loop**: Continuously update the secondary model with new training metrics to refine its learning rate predictions over time.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use the following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`"cifar10"`)
2. **Natural Language Processing**: GLUE - SST-2 (`"glue", "sst2"`)

These datasets are chosen to assess the performance of the proposed framework across different domains.

#### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Primary Model**:
   - **Image Classification**: ResNet-18
   - **NLP**: BERT Base

2. **Secondary Model**: 
   - A simple feed-forward network with the following architecture:
     - Input Layer: Number of neurons equal to the number of features in the training metrics (loss, gradients, etc.)
     - Hidden Layer 1: 64 neurons, ReLU activation
     - Hidden Layer 2: 32 neurons, ReLU activation
     - Output Layer: Single neuron, predicting the learning rate

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Primary Model (ResNet-18)**:
  - Initial Learning Rate: 0.01
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 50
  - Optimizer: SGD

- **Primary Model (BERT Base)**:
  - Initial Learning Rate: 2e-5
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 3
  - Optimizer: AdamW

- **Secondary Model**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 10
  - Optimizer: Adam

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary Model**:
  - **Image Classification**:
    - Accuracy
    - Loss (Cross-Entropy)
  - **NLP**:
    - Accuracy
    - F1 Score
    - Loss (Cross-Entropy)

- **Learning Rate Adaptation**:
  - Convergence Speed: Number of epochs to reach a certain accuracy on the validation set
  - Stability: Variance in the loss over the training period

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the efficacy of an adaptive learning rate optimization framework driven by meta-learning. The evaluation will focus on both the performance improvements in the primary models and the efficiency of the dynamic learning rate adjustments.
