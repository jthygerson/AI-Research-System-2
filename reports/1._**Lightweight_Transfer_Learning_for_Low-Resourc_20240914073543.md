# Experiment Plan: Lightweight Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Environments

## 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of lightweight transfer learning techniques in improving the performance of AI models in low-resource environments. Specifically, we aim to determine whether pre-trained models, when fine-tuned on small datasets, can achieve comparable performance to models trained from scratch on larger datasets.

## 2. Methodology
### Experimental Steps:
1. **Pre-training**: Select a pre-trained model from a large dataset.
2. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on smaller, domain-specific datasets.
3. **Baseline Comparison**: Train models from scratch on the same small datasets for comparison.
4. **Evaluation**: Use evaluation metrics to compare the performance of fine-tuned models against models trained from scratch.

### Experimental Design:
- **Step 1**: Choose a well-known pre-trained model (like BERT, GPT-2, etc.).
- **Step 2**: Select small, domain-specific datasets from Hugging Face Datasets.
- **Step 3**: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the small datasets.
- **Step 4**: Train a comparable model from scratch using the same small datasets.
- **Step 5**: Evaluate both models using standard evaluation metrics.
- **Step 6**: Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of lightweight transfer learning.

## 3. Datasets
The following datasets will be used, sourced from Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **AG News**: A dataset for text classification tasks in the news domain.

2. **TREC**: A dataset for question classification tasks.
   - Source: [TREC on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trec)
3. **Emotion**: A dataset for emotion classification tasks.
   - Source: [Emotion on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emotion)

## 4. Model Architecture
### Pre-trained Model:
- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
  - Source: [BERT on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)

### From-Scratch Model:
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - A neural network model capable of learning long-term dependencies.

## 5. Hyperparameters
### Fine-tuning Hyperparameters (for BERT):
- `learning_rate`: 2e-5
- `batch_size`: 16
- `epochs`: 3
- `max_seq_length`: 128
- `dropout_rate`: 0.1
- `optimizer`: AdamW

### From-Scratch Training Hyperparameters (for LSTM):
- `learning_rate`: 0.001
- `batch_size`: 32
- `epochs`: 10
- `embedding_dim`: 100
- `hidden_units`: 128
- `dropout_rate`: 0.5
- `optimizer`: Adam

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics will be used to evaluate the performance of the models:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Inference Time**: The time taken to make predictions on the test set.
- **Model Size**: The total size of the model (in MB).

### Evaluation Procedure:
- Split each dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test).
- Train both the fine-tuned and from-scratch models.
- Evaluate the models on the test set using the aforementioned metrics.
- Compare the results to determine the effectiveness of lightweight transfer learning in low-resource environments.
