# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers:** Develop a l

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers:** Develop a lightweight, dynamically adaptive learning rate scheduler that modifies learning rates based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy). This scheduler could use reinforcement learning or simple heuristics to adjust the learning rate without requiring extensive computational resources.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a dynamically adaptive learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate in real-time based on the model's performance metrics. The hypothesis is that such an adaptive scheduler will lead to improved model performance and faster convergence compared to traditional fixed or pre-defined learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Design:** Develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to adjust learning rates. The RL agent will receive feedback from model performance metrics such as loss and accuracy at each epoch.
- **Baseline:** Compare the adaptive scheduler against standard learning rate schedules such as fixed, step decay, and cosine annealing.
- **Implementation:** Incorporate the adaptive scheduler into the training loop of a selected deep learning model. The RL agent will be a simple policy gradient method given the lightweight constraint.
- **Training Procedure:** Train the model using both the adaptive scheduler and the baseline schedulers. Measure and compare their performance over multiple runs to ensure statistical significance.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10:** A widely used dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
  - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`cifar10`)
- **IMDB Reviews:** A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 highly polar movie reviews.
  - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`imdb`)
- **MNIST:** A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
  - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`mnist`)

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10 and MNIST):** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Architecture: VGG-16 or ResNet-18
- **Text Classification (IMDB Reviews):** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer-based model
  - Architecture: LSTM or BERT

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate:** Initial learning rate (fixed) = 0.001
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **RL Agent Learning Rate:** 0.01
- **Discount Factor (γ) for RL Agent:** 0.99
- **Exploration Rate (ε) for RL Agent:** 0.1 (decay over time)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Measure the classification accuracy on the validation set after each epoch.
- **Loss:** Track the cross-entropy loss on the validation set after each epoch.
- **Convergence Speed:** Number of epochs required to reach a certain accuracy threshold.
- **Training Time:** Total time taken to complete training.
- **Stability:** Variance in performance metrics across multiple runs.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive learning rate scheduler in improving the performance and training efficiency of AI models across different types of datasets and tasks.
