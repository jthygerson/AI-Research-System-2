### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Loss Landscape Analysis

#### 1. Objective
The main objective of this experiment is to evaluate the efficacy of adaptive learning rate schedulers that dynamically adjust learning rates based on the analysis of the loss landscape. The hypothesis is that these adaptive schedulers can lead to faster convergence and better performance compared to conventional fixed or pre-defined scheduler methods.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler Design**:
   - Develop a learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the local curvature of the loss landscape, using second-order derivative information or approximations.
   
2. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Implement standard learning rate schedulers such as Step Decay, Exponential Decay, and Cosine Annealing for comparison.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - Train several deep learning models using both the adaptive scheduler and the baseline schedulers.
   - Monitor and record the loss, learning rate, and other relevant statistics during training.

4. **Loss Landscape Analysis**:
   - Periodically analyze the loss landscape by calculating the Hessian or using techniques like eigenvalue decomposition to understand the local curvature.
   - Adjust the learning rate accordingly based on the curvature information.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of models trained with the adaptive scheduler against those trained with baseline schedulers using predefined evaluation metrics.
