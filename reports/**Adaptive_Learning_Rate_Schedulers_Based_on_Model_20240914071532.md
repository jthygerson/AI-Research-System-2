# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Model

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Model Uncertainty**: Propose a learning rate scheduler that adapts dynamically based on the model's uncertainty metrics, such as variance in predictions or gradient norms. This can improve convergence speed and model performance without requiring extensive computational resources for hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Model Uncertainty

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate schedulers that adjust learning rates dynamically based on model uncertainty metrics. Specifically, we aim to test whether such schedulers can improve convergence speed and overall model performance compared to traditional fixed or predefined learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Baseline Model Training**: Train baseline models using standard learning rate schedulers such as step decay, cosine annealing, and exponential decay.
- **Step 2: Uncertainty Measurement**: Implement methods to measure model uncertainty using variance in predictions and gradient norms.
- **Step 3: Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler Implementation**: Develop adaptive learning rate schedulers that adjust the learning rate based on the measured uncertainty metrics.
- **Step 4: Experimental Training**: Train models with the adaptive learning rate schedulers.
- **Step 5: Comparative Analysis**: Compare the performance of models trained with adaptive learning rate schedulers against those trained with standard schedulers.

#### 3. Datasets
- **MNIST** (for image classification tasks)
- **IMDB** (for sentiment analysis tasks)
- **SQuAD** (for question answering tasks)
  
Datasets can be sourced from the Hugging Face Datasets library:
- MNIST: `datasets.load_dataset('mnist')`
- IMDB: `datasets.load_dataset('imdb')`
- SQuAD: `datasets.load_dataset('squad')`

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as LeNet-5.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network or a Transformer-based model like BERT.
- **Question Answering**: Transformer-based model like BERT or RoBERTa.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Batch Size**: `32`
- **Initial Learning Rate**: `0.001`
- **Epochs**: `50`
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`
- **Baseline Learning Rate Schedulers**:
  - Step Decay: `{ 'step_size': 10, 'gamma': 0.1 }`
  - Cosine Annealing: `{ 'T_max': 50, 'eta_min': 0 }`
  - Exponential Decay: `{ 'gamma': 0.95 }`
- **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler Parameters**:
  - Variance Threshold: `0.01`
  - Gradient Norm Threshold: `0.1`
  - Learning Rate Adjustment Factor: `0.5`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined validation loss or accuracy threshold.
- **Model Performance**: 
  - For Image Classification (MNIST): Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
  - For Sentiment Analysis (IMDB): Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
  - For Question Answering (SQuAD): Exact Match (EM) score, F1-Score.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Computational resources consumed, measured in GPU hours.

### Implementation Details
1. **Baseline Model Training**: Train each model on the respective dataset using the specified baseline learning rate schedulers.
2. **Uncertainty Measurement**:
   - **Variance in Predictions**: For each batch, compute the variance in the model's predictions.
   - **Gradient Norms**: Compute the norm of the gradients during backpropagation.
3. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler**:
   - If model uncertainty (variance or gradient norm) exceeds the specified threshold, reduce the learning rate by the adjustment factor.
   - Conversely, if uncertainty is below the threshold, increase the learning rate by a smaller adjustment factor to allow for finer learning.
4. **Experimental Training**: Train the models using the adaptive learning rate scheduler, ensuring that the only variable changed from the baseline experiments is the learning rate scheduling strategy.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Use the evaluation metrics to compare the performance and efficiency of models using the adaptive learning rate scheduler against those using traditional schedulers.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to validate the hypothesis that adaptive learning rate schedulers based on model uncertainty can provide significant improvements in training efficiency and model performance.
