# Experiment Report: **Lightweight Attention Mechanism**: Develop a new

## Idea
**Lightweight Attention Mechanism**: Develop a new, efficient attention mechanism that reduces computational overhead while maintaining or improving the performance of Transformer-based models. Implement this mechanism in a smaller Transformer model and evaluate its effectiveness on a language modeling task.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Lightweight Attention Mechanism for Transformer Models

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a new, efficient attention mechanism that reduces the computational overhead of Transformer-based models while maintaining or improving their performance. The effectiveness of this lightweight attention mechanism will be evaluated on a language modeling task.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Design the Lightweight Attention Mechanism**:
    - Develop a novel attention mechanism that reduces computational complexity without significantly compromising the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.
    - Ensure that the new mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer architectures.

2. **Implementation**:
    - Integrate the lightweight attention mechanism into a smaller Transformer model, such as DistilBERT or TinyBERT.
    - Implement the modified model using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

3. **Training**:
    - Train the modified Transformer model on a language modeling task using a well-known dataset.
    - Use standard training practices, including data preprocessing, tokenization, and model optimization techniques.

4. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the performance of the modified model on a validation and test set.
    - Compare the performance metrics and computational overhead (e.g., inference time, memory usage) of the modified model against a baseline model with standard attention mechanisms.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets, available on Hugging Face Datasets, will be used for training and evaluation:
- **Training Dataset**: WikiText-103
    - Source: `wikitext`
    - Description: A large-scale dataset for language modeling, consisting of over 100 million tokens extracted from Wikipedia articles.
- **Validation and Test Datasets**: Penn Treebank (PTB)
    - Source: `ptb_text_only`
    - Description: A standard dataset for language modeling tasks, consisting of sentences from the Wall Street Journal.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Baseline Model**: DistilBERT (a smaller, distilled version of BERT)
    - Source: `distilbert-base-uncased`
- **Modified Model**: DistilBERT with Lightweight Attention Mechanism
    - Architecture:
        - Input Embeddings: Same as DistilBERT
        - Encoder Layers: Replace standard self-attention layers with lightweight attention mechanism
        - Feed-Forward Networks: Same as DistilBERT
        - Output Layer: Same as DistilBERT

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 3e-5
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Number of Epochs**: 5
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
    - `lr`: 3e-5
    - `betas`: (0.9, 0.999)
    - `epsilon`: 1e-8
- **Weight Decay**: 0.01
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.1
- **Max Sequence Length**: 512
- **Warmup Steps**: 500

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Perplexity**: Measures how well the model predicts the test set. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted tokens.
- **Inference Time**: Measures the time taken for the model to generate predictions on the test set.
- **Memory Usage**: Measures the peak memory usage during inference.
- **FLOPs (Floating Point Operations)**: Measures the computational complexity of the model.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed lightweight attention mechanism in Transformer-based models for language modeling tasks.
