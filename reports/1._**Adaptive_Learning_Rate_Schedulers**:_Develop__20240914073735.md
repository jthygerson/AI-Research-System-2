# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers**: Develop 

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers**: Develop a new adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time measures of model performance and convergence indicators. This scheduler could use lightweight reinforcement learning to optimize the learning rate for each epoch, aiming to reduce training time while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a new adaptive learning rate scheduler that uses lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on real-time measures of model performance and convergence indicators. The goal is to reduce training time while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

### 2. Methodology

1. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Train several models using standard learning rate schedulers (e.g., StepLR, ExponentialLR, CosineAnnealingLR) to serve as baselines.
   
2. **Adaptive Scheduler Design**:
   - Develop a lightweight RL-based adaptive learning rate scheduler.
   - The RL agent will receive real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics and convergence indicators.
   - The agent will adjust the learning rate at the end of each epoch.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - Train the same models using the new adaptive scheduler.
   - Compare the training time and model accuracy against the baselines.

4. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Preprocess datasets to ensure compatibility with the models.
   - Implement data augmentation techniques if necessary.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
   - Compare the training time and final accuracy between models trained with standard schedulers and the adaptive scheduler.
