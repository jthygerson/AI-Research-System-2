### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate schedules optimized through reinforcement learning (RL) in improving the performance of AI models. The hypothesis is that RL can dynamically adjust the learning rate for better convergence and generalization compared to traditional static or manually-tuned learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Choose a base model and initialize it.
   - Define a reinforcement learning agent responsible for adjusting the learning rate.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
   - The state space consists of the current loss, gradient norms, and any other relevant metrics.
   - The action space involves changing the learning rate (e.g., increase, decrease, keep the same).
   - The reward function is designed based on the model's validation performance (e.g., accuracy, loss).

3. **Training Procedure:**
   - Train the base model in epochs.
   - At the end of each epoch, the RL agent observes the state and selects an action (adjust learning rate).
   - The model is then trained for the next epoch with the updated learning rate.
   - The RL agent receives a reward based on the model's performance on a validation set.

4. **Comparison Baseline:**
   - Train the same model with traditional learning rate schedules (e.g., fixed, step decay, cosine annealing) for comparison.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10:** A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Available on Hugging Face Datasets [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10).
- **IMDB:** A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews. Available on Hugging Face Datasets [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb).

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **For CIFAR-10:**
  - **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - **Architecture:** 
    - Conv Layer (32 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
    - MaxPooling (2x2)
    - Conv Layer (64 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
    - MaxPooling (2x2)
    - Fully Connected Layer (128 units, ReLU)
    - Output Layer (10 units, Softmax)
  
- **For IMDB:**
  - **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM
  - **Architecture:**
    - Embedding Layer (input_dim=5000, output_dim=128)
    - LSTM Layer (128 units)
    - Fully Connected Layer (128 units, ReLU)
    - Output Layer (1 unit, Sigmoid)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Base Model Hyperparameters:**
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Initial Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Epochs: 50
  - Optimizer: Adam

- **Reinforcement Learning Agent Hyperparameters:**
  - Discount Factor (γ): 0.99
  - Learning Rate for Agent: 0.0001
  - Exploration Rate (ε): 0.1 (decay over time)
  - Replay Buffer Size: 10000
  - Batch Size for Agent Training: 32

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **For CIFAR-10:**
  - Accuracy
  - Cross-Entropy Loss
  - Convergence Speed (number of epochs to reach a certain accuracy threshold)

- **For IMDB:**
  - Accuracy
  - Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
  - F1 Score
  - Convergence Speed

Each metric will be compared between the model using the RL-based adaptive learning rate schedule and those using traditional learning rate schedules to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method.
