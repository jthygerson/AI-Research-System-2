# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization via Meta-Lea

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization via Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rates for various layers in a neural network during training. The goal is to improve convergence speed and model accuracy while reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning. Implement and test the approach on a standard dataset like CIFAR-10.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the efficacy of an adaptive learning rate optimization technique via meta-learning in improving convergence speed and final model accuracy for neural networks trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to reduce the need for extensive manual hyperparameter tuning by dynamically adjusting learning rates for various layers during training.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Meta-Learning Algorithm**: Implement a meta-learning algorithm that can adaptively adjust learning rates for different layers of the neural network. The meta-learner will be trained to predict optimal learning rates based on the current training dynamics.
   
2. **Training Procedure**: 
   - **Phase 1**: Train a base model (e.g., a deep convolutional neural network) on CIFAR-10 using a traditional fixed learning rate schedule to establish baseline performance metrics.
   - **Phase 2**: Implement the adaptive learning rate optimization via meta-learning. During training, the meta-learner will update the learning rates for each layer of the base model.
   - **Phase 3**: Compare the performance of the base model trained with a fixed learning rate and the adaptive learning rate optimized model.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Implement the neural network and meta-learning algorithm in a deep learning framework like PyTorch.
   - Use Hugging Face Datasets to load and preprocess CIFAR-10.
   - Train both models on the same hardware setup to ensure consistency in results.

### 3. Datasets
- **Dataset Name**: CIFAR-10
- **Source**: Available on Hugging Face Datasets, accessible via the `datasets` library in Python.

### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Base Model**: ResNet-18 (Residual Network with 18 layers)
   - The ResNet-18 architecture is known for its balance between complexity and performance, making it a suitable candidate for this experiment.
   
2. **Meta-Learner Model**: A simple feed-forward neural network
   - **Input**: Training dynamics features (e.g., gradient norms, loss values)
   - **Output**: Learning rates for each layer of the base model

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Base Model Hyperparameters**:
  - Initial Learning Rate: 0.1
  - Batch Size: 128
  - Optimizer: SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
  - Momentum: 0.9
  - Weight Decay: 5e-4

- **Meta-Learner Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 128
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Meta-Learning Rate Update Frequency: Every 10 steps

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs or iterations required to reach a certain level of accuracy or loss.
- **Final Model Accuracy**: Classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set.
- **Loss**: Cross-entropy loss on the test set.
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Number of tuning iterations required to achieve optimal performance compared to the baseline.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Time taken for training and the computational resources used.

This experiment aims to show that adaptive learning rate optimization via meta-learning can lead to faster convergence, higher final accuracy, and reduced need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, thus making the training process more efficient and effective.
