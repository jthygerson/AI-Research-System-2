# Experiment Report: 3. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Using Reinfo

## Idea
3. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Using Reinforcement Learning**: Create a reinforcement learning-based mechanism that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of training neural networks based on real-time performance metrics. This approach should help in accelerating the training process and improving convergence rates without requiring extensive computational power.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules Using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and test a reinforcement learning-based mechanism that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of neural network training based on real-time performance metrics. This aims to accelerate the training process, improve convergence rates, and enhance overall model performance without significantly increasing computational requirements.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Design an RL agent whose actions are to adjust the learning rate. The state space includes real-time performance metrics like loss, gradient norms, and learning rate history. The reward is based on improvements in validation loss or accuracy.
   
2. **Environment**: The training process of the neural network serves as the environment. The agent interacts with this environment by adjusting the learning rate at predefined intervals (e.g., every epoch).
   
3. **Training Loop**:
   - Initialize the neural network and RL agent.
   - For each epoch, the RL agent observes the current state.
   - The agent decides on an action (learning rate adjustment).
   - Apply the new learning rate and perform a training step.
   - Calculate the reward based on validation performance.
   - Update the RL agent’s policy using the reward.

4. **Baselines**: Compare the RL-based adaptive learning rate schedule with traditional learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, cosine annealing).

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **IMDB**: Large movie review dataset for text classification, useful for testing models on NLP tasks. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**:
  - **Model**: ResNet-18
  - **Description**: A residual neural network with 18 layers, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.

- **Text Classification (IMDB)**:
  - **Model**: BERT (Base, Uncased)
  - **Description**: A transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of text, suitable for various NLP tasks.

  - Optimizer: SGD with momentum 0.9

- **BERT (IMDB)**:
  - Initial Learning Rate: 2e-5
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 3
  - Optimizer: AdamW

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to reach convergence.
- **Convergence Rate**: Number of epochs to reach a specific validation performance threshold.
- **Validation Performance**: Accuracy and loss on the validation set.
- **Final Model Performance**: Test set accuracy and loss.
- **Learning Rate Behavior**: Analysis of the learning rate adjustments made by the RL agent over time.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Setup**: Initialize the neural network and RL agent.
2. **Training Phase**: Train the model using the RL-based adaptive learning rate schedule.
3. **Comparison**: Train the same model using traditional learning rate schedules.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess performance using the specified evaluation metrics.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to determine the effectiveness of reinforcement learning-based adaptive learning rate schedules in improving model training efficiency and performance.
