# Experiment Report: **Efficient Model Pruning via Reinforcement Learni

## Idea
**Efficient Model Pruning via Reinforcement Learning**: Create a reinforcement learning-based approach for model pruning that selectively removes less important neurons or layers. This method should maintain or improve model performance while significantly reducing the model size and inference time, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Model Pruning via Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning-based approach for model pruning. The goal is to selectively remove less important neurons or layers from a pre-trained neural network, maintaining or improving the model's performance while significantly reducing its size and inference time. This makes the model more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones and IoT devices.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Pre-training a Model**: Start by pre-training a neural network on a given dataset to achieve a baseline performance.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Setup**: 
   - **State**: The current architecture of the model including the number of neurons and layers.
   - **Action**: The action space consists of possible pruning actions (e.g., remove a neuron, remove a layer, or do nothing).
   - **Reward**: The reward is a composite metric considering both the model's performance (accuracy, F1 score, etc.) and computational efficiency (memory usage, inference time).
3. **Pruning Agent**: Utilize a reinforcement learning agent (e.g., DQN, PPO) to learn the optimal pruning strategy.
4. **Iterations**: Iteratively apply pruning actions using the RL agent and fine-tune the pruned model to recover any potential performance loss.
5. **Evaluation**: Compare the pruned model against the baseline in terms of size, inference time, and performance metrics.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **Text Classification**: IMDB Reviews, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **Speech Recognition**: LibriSpeech, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
  
#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-50
- **Text Classification**: BERT-base
- **Speech Recognition**: Wav2Vec 2.0

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
  - `learning_rate`: 0.0003
  - `gamma`: 0.99
  - `clip_epsilon`: 0.2
  - `entropy_coeff`: 0.01
- **Pruning Frequency**: 
  - `pruning_step_size`: 0.1 (i.e., prune 10% of neurons/layers at each step)
- **Fine-tuning Learning Rate**: 0.0001
- **Batch Size**: 32 for image and text, 16 for speech
- **Epochs for Fine-tuning**: 5

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy (for image and text classification)
  - F1 Score (for text classification)
  - Word Error Rate (WER) (for speech recognition)
- **Model Size**:
  - Number of Parameters
- **Inference Time**:
  - Time taken per inference on a standard benchmark device
- **Computational Efficiency**:
  - Memory Usage during inference

These sections ensure a comprehensive plan to test the hypothesis that reinforcement learning can effectively prune models while maintaining or enhancing their performance and efficiency.
