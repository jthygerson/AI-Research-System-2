# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop a

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop a lightweight algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics, such as loss and accuracy, during training. This could involve creating a heuristic or rule-based system that fine-tunes the learning rate to avoid both overshooting and slow convergence.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training. The goal is to improve the model's performance by avoiding overshooting and slow convergence, compared to traditional learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
**Step 1: Algorithm Development**
- Develop an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm. This algorithm will monitor real-time performance metrics (loss and accuracy) and adjust the learning rate accordingly.
- The algorithm will employ heuristic rules, such as increasing the learning rate slightly when the loss decreases consistently, and decreasing it when the loss plateaus or increases.

**Step 2: Baseline Comparison**
- Implement traditional learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, exponential decay) for comparison.

**Step 3: Training**
- Train several models using both the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm and traditional learning rate schedules.
- Use the same initialization and random seed for reproducibility.

**Step 4: Evaluation**
- Evaluate the performance of the models using several key metrics.
- Compare the results to determine the efficacy of the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use multiple datasets to ensure the robustness of the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Available on Hugging Face Datasets: `huggingface/cifar10`
- **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification of movie reviews. Available on Hugging Face Datasets: `huggingface/imdb`
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images. Available on Hugging Face Datasets: `huggingface/mnist`

#### 4. Model Architecture
To cover a range of tasks, we will use different model architectures suitable for each dataset:

- **CIFAR-10**: ResNet-18
- **IMDB Reviews**: Bidirectional LSTM
- **MNIST**: Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters for the models and training process are as follows:

- **Initial Learning Rate**: `0.001`
- **Batch Size**: `64`
- **Epochs**: `50`
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`
- **Momentum (for optimizers that require it)**: `0.9`
- **Learning Rate Decay (for baseline comparisons)**:
  - **Step Decay**: `decay_rate=0.1, step_size=10`
  - **Exponential Decay**: `decay_rate=0.96, decay_steps=10000`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Training Loss**: To monitor convergence and stability during training.
- **Validation Loss**: To evaluate the generalization performance of the model.
- **Accuracy**: To measure the correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Convergence Time**: To measure the time taken for the model to converge.
- **Learning Rate Profile**: To visualize how the learning rate changes over time.

**Additional Analysis:**
- **Training Curves**: Plot training and validation loss curves to visually inspect the learning process.
- **Learning Rate vs. Performance**: Analyze the relationship between learning rate adjustments and performance improvements.

#### Conclusion
This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of the adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm by comparing it against traditional learning rate schedules across multiple datasets and model architectures. The results will inform whether dynamic adjustment of learning rates based on real-time feedback can lead to improved training efficiency and model performance.
