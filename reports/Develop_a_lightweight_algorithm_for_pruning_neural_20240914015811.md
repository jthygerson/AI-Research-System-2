# Experiment Report: Develop a lightweight algorithm for pruning neural

## Idea
Develop a lightweight algorithm for pruning neural networks that can be performed in real-time during training. The goal is to reduce model size and computational requirements without significantly sacrificing accuracy. This could involve dynamically adjusting the pruning strategy based on the loss function and gradients during training.

## Experiment Plan
# Experiment Plan for Real-Time Pruning of Neural Networks

## 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and test a lightweight algorithm for pruning neural networks in real-time during training. The goal is to reduce the overall model size and computational requirements without significantly sacrificing accuracy. The pruning strategy should be dynamically adjusted based on the loss function and gradients during training.

## 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Develop a pruning algorithm that operates in real-time, adjusting the network architecture dynamically during training.
   - Implement pruning logic that considers both the loss function and gradients to decide which neurons/weights should be pruned.

2. **Experimental Setup**:
   - Compare the performance of models with and without the real-time pruning algorithm.
   - Train both pruned and non-pruned models on the same datasets and hyperparameters for consistency.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - Train the models with standard backpropagation.
   - For the models with the pruning algorithm, apply pruning at regular intervals during the training process (e.g., every epoch or batch).

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Measure the accuracy, model size, and computational requirements (e.g., FLOPs, inference time) of the pruned and non-pruned models.
   - Conduct statistical tests to determine if the differences in performance metrics are significant.

## 3. Datasets
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **IMDB**: A dataset of 50,000 movie reviews for binary sentiment classification, available on Hugging Face Datasets.

## 4. Model Architecture
- **For MNIST**:
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): 2 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.
- **For CIFAR-10**:
  - ResNet-18: A residual neural network with 18 layers.
- **For IMDB**:
  - LSTM: An LSTM network with an embedding layer followed by 2 LSTM layers and a fully connected layer.

## 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Pruning Interval**: Every 1 epoch
- **Pruning Threshold**: 0.01 (percentage of weights to prune based on gradient magnitude)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy (for classification tasks)

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
- **Model Size**: The number of parameters in the model.
- **Computational Requirements**: Measured in Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPs) and inference time (seconds per batch).
- **Pruning Effectiveness**: Reduction in model size and computational requirements while maintaining accuracy.

This experiment plan aims to rigorously test the hypothesis that a real-time pruning algorithm can effectively reduce model size and computational load without significantly impacting the accuracy of the model. The results will help in understanding the trade-offs and potential benefits of dynamically pruning neural networks during training.
