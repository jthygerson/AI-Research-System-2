# Experiment Report: Develop an adaptive pruning technique that dynamic

## Idea
Develop an adaptive pruning technique that dynamically adjusts the sparsity levels of neural networks during training. This approach would use a feedback mechanism to identify and prune less important weights, thereby reducing model size and improving inference speed without sacrificing accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Pruning Technique for Neural Networks

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and validate an adaptive pruning technique that dynamically adjusts the sparsity levels of neural networks during training. This approach aims to improve the model's performance by reducing its size and enhancing inference speed without compromising accuracy. The feedback mechanism will identify and prune less important weights in real-time.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Baseline Model Training:**
   - Train the baseline neural network model without any pruning to establish a performance benchmark.

2. **Adaptive Pruning Implementation:**
   - Integrate the adaptive pruning technique into the training process. This includes developing a feedback mechanism that evaluates the importance of weights during each training epoch.
   - Implement the pruning algorithm to dynamically adjust the sparsity levels based on the feedback mechanism.

3. **Iterative Training:**
   - Train the modified model with the adaptive pruning technique. Monitor the performance metrics, model size, and inference speed throughout the training process.

4. **Comparison and Analysis:**
   - Compare the performance of the pruned model with the baseline model using predefined evaluation metrics.
   - Analyze the trade-offs between model size, inference speed, and accuracy.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used for this experiment:

- **Image Classification:** CIFAR-10
  - Source: `huggingface/datasets/cifar10`
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)
  - Source: `huggingface/datasets/glue`

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification Model:** ResNet-50
- **NLP Model:** BERT-base-uncased

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Number of Epochs:** 50
- **Pruning Frequency:** Every 5 epochs
- **Initial Sparsity Level:** 20%
- **Final Sparsity Level:** 80%
- **Sparsity Increment:** 10% per pruning step
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Gradient-based importance scoring

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Measure the classification accuracy for both image and text datasets.
- **Model Size:** Measure the number of parameters before and after pruning.
- **Inference Speed:** Measure the time taken for inference on a fixed batch of samples.
- **Training Time:** Measure the time taken to complete the training for both baseline and pruned models.
- **Sparsity Level:** Measure the percentage of pruned weights in the final model.

### Summary
This experiment plan aims to validate the effectiveness of an adaptive pruning technique in improving the performance of neural networks. By dynamically adjusting sparsity levels during training, the goal is to achieve a smaller, faster model that maintains high accuracy. The experiment will use well-known datasets and model architectures, and it will include a comprehensive set of hyperparameters and evaluation metrics to ensure robust and meaningful results.
