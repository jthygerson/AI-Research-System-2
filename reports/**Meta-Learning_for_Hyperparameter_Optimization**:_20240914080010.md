# Experiment Report: **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**:

## Idea
**Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**: Develop a lightweight meta-learning framework that utilizes past hyperparameter tuning experiments to predict optimal hyperparameters for new models. This can involve creating a small dataset of past tuning results and training a simple neural network to recommend hyperparameters, reducing the need for extensive grid searches.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization

#### 1. Objective

The main objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning framework that uses past hyperparameter tuning experiments to predict optimal hyperparameters for new machine learning models. This approach aims to minimize the need for extensive and computationally expensive hyperparameter searches, thereby accelerating the overall model development process.

#### 2. Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect a dataset of past hyperparameter tuning results, including model performance metrics for various hyperparameter configurations.
   - This dataset will be divided into training and test sets for the meta-learning model.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract features from the hyperparameter configurations and corresponding performance metrics.
   - Standardize the features to ensure uniform scaling.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a simple neural network on the collected dataset to predict model performance based on hyperparameter configurations.
   - Use cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.

4. **Hyperparameter Recommendation**:
   - Use the trained meta-learning model to predict optimal hyperparameters for new models.
   - Validate the recommended hyperparameters by training actual ML models using these configurations and comparing their performance with those obtained through traditional grid search methods.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of models trained with meta-learned hyperparameters against those trained with hyperparameters obtained through grid search.
   - Evaluate the time and computational resources saved using the meta-learning approach.

#### 3. Datasets

- **Hugging Face Datasets**:
  - **OpenML**: A dataset containing various machine learning tasks and their corresponding hyperparameter tuning results.
  - **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: A collection of datasets with a wide range of features and complexities, often used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
  - **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for image classification tasks.
  - **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

#### 4. Model Architecture

- **Meta-Learning Model**:
  - Input Layer: Size equal to the number of hyperparameters.
  - Hidden Layers: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
  - Output Layer: Single neuron with linear activation to predict performance metric (e.g., accuracy, loss).

- **Target ML Models for Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (for image datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10)
