# Experiment Report: 4. **Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism using Bayes

## Idea
4. **Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism using Bayesian Optimization**: Design an adaptive early stopping mechanism that employs Bayesian optimization to determine the optimal point to halt training, thus preventing overfitting and reducing computational waste. This method would be particularly useful for models trained on limited resources, ensuring efficient use of available computational power.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate an adaptive early stopping mechanism that leverages Bayesian optimization to determine the optimal point to halt training, thereby preventing overfitting and reducing computational waste. The goal is to ensure efficient use of computational resources, particularly for models trained on limited resources.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Early Stopping Mechanism**:
    - Develop an adaptive early stopping mechanism that uses Bayesian optimization.
    - The Bayesian optimization algorithm will periodically evaluate the model's performance on a validation set and decide whether to continue training or halt based on a predefined acquisition function (e.g., Expected Improvement).

2. **Training Process**:
    - Train multiple models with and without the proposed early stopping mechanism.
    - Compare the performance and computational efficiency between models using traditional early stopping and the Bayesian optimization-based adaptive early stopping.

3. **Bayesian Optimization Setup**:
    - Use Gaussian Processes (GP) as the surrogate model for Bayesian optimization.
    - Define the acquisition function and its parameters to balance exploration and exploitation during the optimization process.

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Performance Metrics**:

  - F1-Score (for classification tasks)
  - Exact Match and F1 (for QA tasks)

- **Efficiency Metrics**:
  - Training Time (total time taken to reach the optimal stopping point)
  - Computational Cost (measured in terms of GPU hours)
  - Number of Epochs Run (to evaluate reduction in training epochs)

### Experimental Steps:
1. **Initial Setup**:
    - Split each dataset into training and validation sets.
    - Initialize models with specified architectures and hyperparameters.

2. **Training with Traditional Early Stopping**:
    - Train each model with traditional early stopping based on validation loss improvement.

3. **Training with Adaptive Early Stopping**:
    - Implement the Bayesian optimization-based early stopping mechanism.
    - Train each model using the adaptive early stopping mechanism.

4. **Evaluation**:
    - Compare the performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, exact match) for models trained with traditional and adaptive early stopping mechanisms.
    - Compare the efficiency metrics (training time, computational cost, number of epochs run) to evaluate the reduction in computational waste.

5. **Analysis**:
    - Perform statistical analysis to determine the significance of differences in performance and efficiency metrics.
    - Discuss the results and potential implications for training models on limited resources.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive early stopping mechanism using Bayesian optimization in improving the efficiency and performance of AI/ML models.
