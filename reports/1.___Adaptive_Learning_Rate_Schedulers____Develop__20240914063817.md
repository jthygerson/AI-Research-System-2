# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers**: Develop 

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers**: Develop and evaluate adaptive learning rate schedulers that dynamically adjust learning rates based on real-time performance metrics like loss convergence rates and gradient norms. This could reduce training time and improve convergence stability.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan for Testing Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers in AI/ML

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate adaptive learning rate schedulers that dynamically adjust the learning rate based on real-time performance metrics, such as loss convergence rates and gradient norms. We aim to determine whether these adaptive schedulers can reduce training time and improve convergence stability in comparison to traditional fixed or manually scheduled learning rates.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Development of Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers**: 
   - Implement adaptive learning rate schedulers that adjust learning rates based on real-time metrics.
   - Metrics to be considered include loss convergence rates and gradient norms.

2. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Use standard learning rate schedulers such as StepLR, ExponentialLR, and ReduceLROnPlateau as baselines for comparison.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train models using both the adaptive learning rate schedulers and the baseline schedulers.
   - Compare training time, convergence stability, and final model performance.

4. **Data Collection**:
   - Track metrics such as training loss, validation loss, training time, and number of epochs to convergence.

5. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform statistical tests to determine the significance of any observed differences.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use the following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10
   - Source: `datasets.load_dataset('cifar10')`

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: GLUE benchmark (General Language Understanding Evaluation)
   - Specifically, the SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) task.
   - Source: `datasets.load_dataset('glue', 'sst2')`

#### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Image Classification Model**:
   - **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   - **Architecture**: ResNet-18

2. **NLP Model**:
   - **Model Type**: Transformer-based model
   - **Architecture**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
   - **Pre-trained Model**: `bert-base-uncased`

#### 5. Hyperparameters
For both models, the following hyperparameters will be used, with adjustments made for each specific task:
1. **Batch Size**: 32
2. **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.001 for CNN, 2e-5 for BERT
3. **Optimizer**: Adam
4. **Epochs**: 50 for CNN, 10 for BERT
5. **Scheduler Hyperparameters**:
   - **StepLR**: `step_size=10`, `gamma=0.1`
   - **ExponentialLR**: `gamma=0.95`
   - **ReduceLROnPlateau**: `mode='min'`, `factor=0.1`, `patience=5`
   - **Adaptive Scheduler**: Parameters will be dynamically adjusted based on real-time metrics.

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
1. **Training Time**: Total time taken to complete training.
2. **Convergence Stability**:
   - Measure the variance in training and validation loss over epochs.
   - Number of epochs to reach a specified loss threshold.
3. **Final Model Performance**:
   - **Image Classification**: Accuracy on the test set.
   - **NLP**: Accuracy and F1 score on the validation set (SST-2 task).
4. **Learning Rate Dynamics**:
   - Plot and analyze the learning rate schedules over time for both adaptive and baseline schedulers.
5. **Gradient Norms**:
   - Track and analyze gradient norms to assess stability throughout training.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate schedulers and their impact on model training and performance.
