# Experiment Report: Develop a streamlined Bayesian optimization framew

## Idea
Develop a streamlined Bayesian optimization framework tailored for lightweight models (e.g., small neural networks or decision trees) that can efficiently identify optimal hyperparameters with minimal computational resources. This project can explore surrogate models and acquisition functions that are computationally inexpensive.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a streamlined Bayesian optimization framework specifically tailored for lightweight models such as small neural networks and decision trees. The aim is to efficiently identify optimal hyperparameters with minimal computational resources by exploring computationally inexpensive surrogate models and acquisition functions.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Framework Development**:
    - Design a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that leverages lightweight surrogate models like Gaussian Processes (GPs) with sparse approximations or Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs).
    - Implement computationally inexpensive acquisition functions such as Expected Improvement (EI), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Probability of Improvement (PI).

2. **Baseline Comparison**:
    - Compare the performance of the streamlined BO framework against traditional grid search and random search methods.

3. **Experimentation**:
    - Run the BO framework on a variety of lightweight models and datasets.
    - Evaluate the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning in terms of both computational resources and model performance.
    
4. **Iteration and Refinement**:
    - Iterate on the BO framework based on initial results.
    - Refine surrogate models and acquisition functions for improved performance.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets will be used, sourced from Hugging Face Datasets:
- **Iris**: A classic dataset for classification tasks.
- **Wine Quality**: A dataset for regression and classification tasks.
- **Boston Housing**: A dataset for regression analysis.
- **MNIST (sample)**: A smaller subset of the MNIST dataset, suitable for lightweight neural networks.

#### 4. Model Architecture
The lightweight models to be optimized include:
- **Small Neural Networks**:
    - 1 to 3 layers.
    - 10 to 100 neurons per layer.
    - Activation functions: ReLU, Tanh.
- **Decision Trees**:
    - Maximum depth: 3 to 10.
    - Minimum samples split: 2 to 10.
    - Criterion: Gini, Entropy.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters for each model type include:
- **Small Neural Networks**:
    - `learning_rate`: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
    - `batch_size`: [16, 32, 64]
    - `num_layers`: [1, 2, 3]
    - `num_neurons`: [10, 50, 100]
    - `activation_function`: ['ReLU', 'Tanh']
- **Decision Trees**:
    - `max_depth`: [3, 5, 7, 10]
    - `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10]
    - `criterion`: ['gini', 'entropy']

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the hyperparameter tuning methods will be assessed using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: For classification tasks, to measure the proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression tasks, to measure the average squared difference between observed and predicted values.
- **Computational Time**: Total time taken for the hyperparameter optimization process.
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU/GPU usage during the optimization process.
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of iterations required to reach the optimal hyperparameters.

#### Conclusion
This experiment aims to create an efficient Bayesian optimization framework for lightweight models that minimizes computational resources while maximizing model performance. By evaluating the framework across multiple datasets and models, we can validate its effectiveness and compare it with traditional hyperparameter optimization methods.
