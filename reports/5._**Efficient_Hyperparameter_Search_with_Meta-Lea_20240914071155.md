# Experiment Report: 5. **Efficient Hyperparameter Search with Meta-Lea

## Idea
5. **Efficient Hyperparameter Search with Meta-Learning**: Implement a meta-learning approach to expedite hyperparameter tuning processes for small-scale models. This involves training a meta-learner to predict optimal hyperparameters based on previous tuning results, reducing the overall search space and computational cost.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Hyperparameter Search with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to implement and evaluate a meta-learning approach to expedite the hyperparameter tuning process for small-scale machine learning models. By training a meta-learner to predict optimal hyperparameters based on historical tuning results, we aim to reduce the overall search space and computational cost, thereby improving the efficiency and performance of the AI Research System.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Meta-Learner Training**:
  - Collect historical hyperparameter optimization data from previous experiments involving small-scale models.
  - Train a meta-learner (e.g., a neural network or a gradient boosting machine) to map from dataset characteristics and initial hyperparameter settings to performance metrics.
  - Use this trained meta-learner to predict a promising region of the hyperparameter space for new models and datasets.

- **Experimentation**:
  - Select several small-scale models and datasets.
  - For each dataset, perform hyperparameter tuning using two approaches:
    1. Traditional grid search or random search.
    2. Meta-learning informed search.
  - Compare the performance and computational resources required for both approaches.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Datasets from Hugging Face Datasets**:
  - **Iris**: A classic dataset for classification tasks.
  - **Wine Quality**: Used for regression and classification tasks.
  - **Boston Housing**: A regression dataset predicting housing prices.
  - **MNIST**: For image classification tasks.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Classification Models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: A simple and interpretable model for binary classification.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional spaces.
  - **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method.
  - **Neural Network**: A small-scale feed-forward neural network.

- **Regression Models**:
  - **Linear Regression**: A fundamental approach for regression tasks.
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**: A non-linear model for regression.
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An ensemble method that builds models sequentially.

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification Tasks**:
  - **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
  - **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - **AUC-ROC**: The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.

- **Regression Tasks**:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
  - **R-squared (RÂ²)**: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

- **Efficiency Metrics**:
  - **Computational Time**: Total time taken for hyperparameter tuning.
  - **Number of Evaluations**: Total number of hyperparameter settings evaluated.

By comparing the performance and efficiency metrics of the traditional and meta-learning informed hyperparameter tuning approaches, we can assess the effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning strategy.
