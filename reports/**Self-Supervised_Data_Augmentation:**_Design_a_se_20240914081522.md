# Experiment Report: **Self-Supervised Data Augmentation:** Design a se

## Idea
**Self-Supervised Data Augmentation:** Design a self-supervised learning algorithm that generates augmented data samples based on the model's current learning state. This method would aim to enhance the diversity and quality of training data, leading to improved model robustness and generalization with minimal additional computational cost.

## Experiment Plan
### Self-Supervised Data Augmentation Experiment Plan

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-supervised data augmentation algorithm designed to generate augmented data samples based on the model's current learning state. The primary aim is to enhance the diversity and quality of training data, thereby improving model robustness and generalization with minimal additional computational cost.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Training**: Begin by training a baseline model using a standard dataset.
2. **Self-Supervised Data Augmentation**:
   - Implement a self-supervised learning algorithm that generates augmented data samples.
   - Use the model's current state (e.g., learned weights and intermediate activations) to inform the generation of these samples.
   - Augmentation techniques may include transformations, noise addition, or synthetic data generation.
3. **Retraining**: Train the model further by combining the original dataset with the augmented data.
4. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of the model trained with the augmented data against the baseline model.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Original Dataset**: 
  - **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
  - **Hugging Face Datasets**: Available at `https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10`

- **Augmented Dataset**: 
  - Generated using the self-supervised data augmentation algorithm based on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Baseline Model**:
  - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: 
    - **Layers**:
      - Convolutional Layer: Filters=32, Kernel Size=3x3, Activation=ReLU
      - Max Pooling: Pool Size=2x2
      - Convolutional Layer: Filters=64, Kernel Size=3x3, Activation=ReLU
      - Max Pooling: Pool Size=2x2
      - Fully Connected Layer: Units=128, Activation=ReLU
      - Output Layer: Units=10 (for CIFAR-10), Activation=Softmax

- **Augmented Model**:
  - Same architecture as the baseline model, but trained with both the original and augmented datasets.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Data Augmentation Parameters**:
  - **Transformation Probability**: 0.5
  - **Noise Level**: 0.1 (for noise addition)
  - **Synthetic Data Ratio**: 0.2 (percentage of synthetic data in each batch)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified samples.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To analyze the performance of the classifier in more detail.
- **Robustness Tests**: Evaluate performance under various noise levels and transformations not seen during training.

### Experiment Execution
1. **Baseline Model Training**:
   - Train the baseline CNN model on the original CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Record the evaluation metrics for the baseline model.

2. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Implement the self-supervised data augmentation algorithm.
   - Generate augmented data samples using the trained baseline model's current learning state.

3. **Augmented Model Training**:
   - Train a new CNN model on the combined dataset (original + augmented).
   - Record the evaluation metrics for the augmented model.

4. **Comparison and Analysis**:
   - Compare the evaluation metrics of the baseline model and the augmented model.
   - Analyze improvements in robustness, generalization, and overall performance.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to discern the impact of self-supervised data augmentation on the model's performance and verify whether it leads to significant improvements in robustness and generalization.

**Original Code:**
```python
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)

        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
import torch.nn as nn

class EnhancedModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(EnhancedModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
