# Experiment Report: 4. **Lightweight Knowledge Distillation with Progr

## Idea
4. **Lightweight Knowledge Distillation with Progressive Layer Freezing**: Design a knowledge distillation process that transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model by progressively freezing layers of the student model, thereby reducing the training time and computational resources required for effective distillation.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Lightweight Knowledge Distillation with Progressive Layer Freezing

#### 1. Objective
The primary goal of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel knowledge distillation approach that involves progressively freezing the layers of a smaller student model. This method aims to reduce the training time and computational resources required while maintaining or improving the performance of the student model compared to traditional knowledge distillation techniques.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment involves the following steps:

1. **Teacher Model Training**: Train a large teacher model on the selected dataset until convergence.
2. **Initial Student Model Setup**: Initialize a smaller student model with the same architecture as the teacher model but fewer parameters.
3. **Progressive Layer Freezing**:
   - Divide the student model into multiple segments or stages.
   - During each stage, progressively freeze a subset of layers, starting from the bottom layers.
   - Train the unfrozen layers using the logits (soft targets) provided by the teacher model.
4. **Knowledge Distillation**:
   - Use the teacher model to generate soft targets for the entire dataset.
   - Train the student model using a combination of soft targets (from the teacher) and hard targets (actual labels).
5. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the student model with and without progressive layer freezing.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use the following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:

- **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **SQuAD 2.0**: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset, used for evaluating reading comprehension systems.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Teacher Model**: 
  - For CIFAR-10: ResNet-50
  - For SQuAD 2.0: BERT-Large
- **Student Model**:
  - For CIFAR-10: ResNet-18
  - For SQuAD 2.0: DistilBERT

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**:
  - Teacher Model (CIFAR-10): 0.1
  - Student Model (CIFAR-10): 0.01
  - Teacher Model (SQuAD 2.0): 3e-5
  - Student Model (SQuAD 2.0): 5e-5
- **Batch Size**: 
  - CIFAR-10: 128
  - SQuAD 2.0: 16
- **Epochs**:
  - Teacher Model: 100 (CIFAR-10), 3 (SQuAD 2.0)
  - Student Model: 50 (CIFAR-10), 2 (SQuAD 2.0)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Weight Decay**: 0.0001
- **Distillation Temperature**: 4
- **Alpha (Weight of Soft Targets in Loss Function)**: 0.7
- **Layer Freezing Schedule**: Freeze one additional layer every 10 epochs for CIFAR-10; every 1 epoch for SQuAD 2.0

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: For CIFAR-10, accuracy will be the primary metric.
- **F1 Score**: For SQuAD 2.0, F1 score will be used to evaluate the performance.
- **Training Time**: Measure the total training time for both traditional and progressive layer freezing approaches.
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor GPU/CPU usage and memory consumption during training.

This experiment aims to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the benefits of progressive layer freezing in knowledge distillation, examining both performance and computational efficiency.
