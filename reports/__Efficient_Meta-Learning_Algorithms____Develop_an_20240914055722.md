## Idea
**Efficient Meta-Learning Algorithms**: Develop and benchmark a lightweight meta-learning algorithm aimed at rapidly adapting neural network models to new tasks with minimal data. This could involve exploring novel gradient-based or black-box optimization techniques that reduce computational overhead, making them feasible to run on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Meta-Learning Algorithms

---

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and benchmark a lightweight meta-learning algorithm that rapidly adapts neural network models to new tasks with minimal data. The focus is on exploring gradient-based or black-box optimization techniques that reduce computational overhead, making them feasible to run on a single GPU.

---

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**: 
   - Develop two meta-learning algorithms: one gradient-based (e.g., MAML) and one black-box optimization technique (e.g., Bayesian Optimization).
   - Implement these algorithms in a lightweight manner, ensuring they can be executed on a single GPU.

2. **Training and Adaptation**:
   - Train the meta-learner on a variety of tasks to learn a good initialization for rapid adaptation.
   - Evaluate the performance of the meta-learner on new, unseen tasks with minimal data.

3. **Benchmarking**:
   - Compare the performance of the two algorithms in terms of adaptation speed, accuracy, and computational resources.
   - Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of the algorithms to their overall performance.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Meta-Dataset**: A collection of datasets suitable for few-shot learning and meta-learning.
  1. **Mini-Imagenet**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset, preprocessed for few-shot learning tasks.
  2. **Omniglot**: A dataset of handwritten characters from various alphabets, also used for few-shot learning.
  3. **CIFAR-FS**: A few-shot learning version of the CIFAR-100 dataset.
  4. **CelebA**: CelebFaces Attributes Dataset, used for tasks like attribute prediction with few examples.

These datasets are available on the Hugging Face Datasets library.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Meta-Learner**: 
  - **Gradient-Based Approach**: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN).
  - **Black-Box Optimization Approach**: Bayesian Optimization-based meta-learning using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

- **Task-Specific Learner**:
  - For the gradient-based approach, we will use a CNN with 4 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers.
  - For the black-box optimization approach, we will use an MLP with 3 hidden layers.
