# Experiment Report: 3. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization

## Idea
3. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization**: Develop a meta-learning approach to optimize hyperparameters of AI models efficiently. The method would involve training a meta-learner on a variety of small-scale tasks to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks, reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter searches and making it feasible to perform on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning approach for hyperparameter optimization. The goal is to train a meta-learner on various small-scale tasks to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks, thereby reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter searches and making it computationally feasible to perform on a single GPU.

#### 2. Methodology
**Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
- Collect a diverse set of small-scale tasks from different domains (e.g., image classification, text classification).
- Preprocess these datasets to ensure consistency in format and normalization.

**Step 2: Meta-Learner Training**
- Use a meta-learning framework to train the meta-learner. The meta-learner will be trained to predict hyperparameters that optimize performance on these small-scale tasks.
- Implement a meta-learning algorithm such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) or Reptile to train the meta-learner.

**Step 3: Hyperparameter Prediction**
- For each new task, use the trained meta-learner to predict optimal hyperparameters.
- Apply the predicted hyperparameters to train the target AI model on the new task.

**Step 4: Evaluation**
- Compare the performance of the meta-learned hyperparameters with traditional hyperparameter optimization methods like Random Search and Bayesian Optimization.
- Measure the computational efficiency in terms of the number of GPU hours required.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10, MNIST (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Text Classification**: AG News, IMDb Reviews (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Small-scale Tasks**: Subsets of larger datasets or specific benchmark datasets designed for meta-learning research such as Omniglot, FewRel.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Meta-Learner Architecture**: A simple feedforward neural network or a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict hyperparameters.
- **Target AI Models**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.
  - Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for text classification tasks.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: Continuous value, typically between 0.0001 and 0.1.
- **Batch Size**: Discrete values, typically 16, 32, 64, and 128.
- **Number of Layers**: Discrete values, usually 2, 3, 4, and 5 for CNNs or Transformer models.
- **Dropout Rate**: Continuous value, ranging from 0 to 0.5.
- **Optimizer**: Categorical values, e.g., 'Adam', 'SGD', 'RMSprop'.

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy for classification tasks (e.g., top-1 accuracy for image classification, F1-score for text classification).
- **Hyperparameter Optimization Efficiency**:
  - Number of GPU hours required for hyperparameter optimization.
  - Number of iterations needed to converge.
- **Generalization Ability**:
  - Performance of the meta-learned hyperparameters on unseen tasks.
- **Computational Cost**:
  - Total computational resources (e.g., GPU hours, memory usage) consumed during training and hyperparameter optimization.

### Conclusion

from transformers import AdamW

# Model and data initialization code here...

optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

for epoch in range(1):
    model.train()

optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-5)

# Adding a learning rate scheduler
total_steps = len(train_dataloader) * 3  # Assuming we increase epochs to 3
scheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=0, num_training_steps=total_steps)

for epoch in range(3):  # Increasing epochs to 3
    model.train()
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        # Training loop code here...
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()  # Update learning rate schedule
        optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Evaluation code here...
