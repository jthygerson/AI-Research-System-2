# Experiment Report: Create a meta-learning framework that utilizes a s

## Idea
Create a meta-learning framework that utilizes a small set of prior trained models to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks. This approach aims to significantly reduce the time and computational cost associated with hyperparameter tuning by leveraging knowledge from similar past training runs, making it feasible to execute within a week on limited hardware.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning Framework for Hyperparameter Prediction

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to design and validate a meta-learning framework that can predict optimal hyperparameters for new machine learning tasks. By leveraging a small set of prior trained models, the framework aims to reduce the time and computational cost associated with hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to achieve comparable or improved performance while being executable within a week on limited hardware.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Data Collection**  
  Gather a diverse set of prior trained models along with their hyperparameters and performance metrics on various datasets.
  
- **Step 2: Meta-Feature Extraction**  
  Extract meta-features from each dataset (e.g., dataset size, number of features, feature types) and trained model (e.g., architecture, layer types, training epochs).

- **Step 3: Meta-Learner Training**  
  Train a meta-learner to predict optimal hyperparameters for new tasks based on the meta-features and past performance data. A regression model, such as a Random Forest Regressor, could be used for this purpose.

- **Step 4: Evaluation Setup**  
  For new tasks, use the meta-learner to predict hyperparameters and evaluate the performance of the trained models on these tasks. Compare the results with a baseline method that uses random or grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

- **Step 5: Performance Analysis**  
  Analyze the performance of the meta-learning framework in terms of computational cost, time saved, and model accuracy.

  - **Hugging Face Datasets Collection**: Any additional datasets for diverse tasks.

#### 4. Model Architecture
