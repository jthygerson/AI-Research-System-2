# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers with Meta-Lear

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers with Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rates during training based on real-time model performance metrics. The goal is to create a lightweight, adaptive scheduler that can optimize training efficiency and convergence speed across various tasks.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rates during training based on real-time model performance metrics. The aim is to create an adaptive scheduler that improves training efficiency and convergence speed across various tasks in AI/ML.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Meta-Learning Algorithm**: Develop a reinforcement learning-based meta-learner that takes in real-time performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) and outputs optimal learning rates.
- **Training Process**:
  1. Split the entire dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
  2. Train a base model on the training set while the meta-learner adjusts the learning rate at each epoch based on validation set performance.
  3. Evaluate the meta-learner's performance by comparing it against static learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, cosine annealing).
- **Implementation**: Use Python and popular ML libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Natural Language Processing**: GLUE Benchmark (specifically, the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Speech Recognition**: LibriSpeech ASR corpus (available on Hugging Face Datasets)

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-50
- **Natural Language Processing**: BERT (base-uncased)
- **Speech Recognition**: Wav2Vec 2.0 (base)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 1e-3
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Meta-Learner Learning Rate**: 1e-4
- **Meta-Learner Update Frequency**: Every epoch
- **Regularization (Weight Decay)**: 1e-5
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.5 (for NLP and Image Classification tasks)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Efficiency**: Time to convergence (measured in epochs and wall-clock time)
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a specified performance threshold (e.g., 90% accuracy for classification tasks)
- **Final Model Performance**: Accuracy, F1-score (for classification tasks), and Word Error Rate (WER) for speech recognition
- **Learning Rate Adaptation Quality**: Stability and variability of learning rate adjustments over time

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the base model with predefined architectures (ResNet-50, BERT, Wav2Vec 2.0).
   - Initialize the meta-learner with a random policy for adjusting learning rates.

2. **Training and Meta-Learning Loop**:
   - For each epoch:
     - Train the base model on the training set with the current learning rate.
     - Evaluate the model on the validation set to obtain performance metrics.
     - Update the meta-learner's policy using the collected performance metrics.
     - Adjust the learning rate based on the meta-learner's output.
   - Continue the loop until the maximum number of epochs is reached or early stopping criteria are met.

3. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Train the same models using standard learning rate schedules (constant, step decay, cosine annealing).
   - Compare the performance metrics and training efficiency of the meta-learning-based adaptive scheduler against these baselines.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the final model performance on the test set.
   - Analyze the convergence speed and training efficiency.
   - Assess the effectiveness of the adaptive learning rate scheduler in terms of learning rate stability and variability.

5. **Reporting**:
   - Compile the results and generate detailed plots showing learning rate adjustments over epochs, convergence curves, and performance metrics.
   - Write a comprehensive report discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed adaptive learning rate scheduler with meta-learning.
