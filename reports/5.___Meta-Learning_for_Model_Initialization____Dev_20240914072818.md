# Experiment Report: 5. **Meta-Learning for Model Initialization**: Dev

## Idea
5. **Meta-Learning for Model Initialization**: Develop a meta-learning framework that learns optimal weight initializations across different tasks and datasets. This would involve training a meta-model on a variety of small tasks to predict good starting points for new models, thereby reducing the training time and improving the convergence rate of models trained on new tasks with limited computational resources.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Model Initialization

### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning framework that optimizes weight initializations for deep learning models. By training a meta-model on a variety of small tasks, we aim to predict effective initial weights for new models, thereby reducing training time and improving convergence rates, especially in scenarios with limited computational resources.

### 2. Methodology
The experiment will follow these steps:

1. **Meta-Model Training:**
   - Collect a diverse set of tasks and datasets.
   - Train multiple base models on these tasks to gather information about optimal weight initializations.
   - Use this information to train a meta-model that can predict optimal weight initializations for new tasks.

2. **Evaluation on New Tasks:**
   - Select a set of unseen tasks and datasets.
   - Initialize models with weights predicted by the meta-model.
   - Compare the performance, training time, and convergence rate of these models against models initialized with standard methods (e.g., Xavier or He initialization).

### 3. Datasets
We will use a variety of datasets from Hugging Face Datasets to ensure diversity in the tasks:

1. **Image Classification:**
   - CIFAR-10 (`cifar10`)
   - MNIST (`mnist`)
   - Fashion-MNIST (`fashion_mnist`)

2. **Text Classification:**
   - AG News (`ag_news`)
   - IMDB Reviews (`imdb`)
   - Yelp Reviews (`yelp_review_full`)

3. **Regression:**
   - Boston Housing (`boston_housing`)
   - Diabetes (`diabetes`)

### 4. Model Architecture
We will use different model architectures suitable for the tasks at hand:

1. **Image Classification:**
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
     - Simple CNN (3 convolutional layers + 2 fully connected layers)
     - ResNet-18

2. **Text Classification:**
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
     - LSTM (2 layers)
   - Transformer-based models
     - BERT (Base model)

3. **Regression:**
   - Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)
     - Shallow FCNN (2 hidden layers)
     - Deep FCNN (4 hidden layers)

### 5. Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters for the experiment are:

- **Meta-Model:**
  - Learning Rate: `0.001`
  - Batch Size: `32`
  - Epochs: `50`
  - Optimizer: `Adam`

- **Task-Specific Models:**
  - Learning Rate: `0.01`
  - Batch Size: `64`
  - Epochs: `100`
  - Optimizer: `SGD` for image tasks, `Adam` for text tasks

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the meta-learning framework will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

1. **Training Time:**
   - Measure the total time taken to train models initialized by the meta-model versus standard initialization methods.

2. **Convergence Rate:**
   - Track the number of epochs required for the model to converge to a predefined performance threshold.

3. **Accuracy:**
   - For classification tasks, measure the accuracy of the models on validation and test sets.

4. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
   - For regression tasks, measure the MSE on validation and test sets.

5. **Loss Reduction:**
   - Compare the reduction in training loss over time between models initialized by the meta-model and standard methods.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to validate the effectiveness of meta-learning for model initialization in improving training efficiency and performance across various tasks.

### File: model_training.py
**Original Code:**
```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)))  # Increased units
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))  # Increased units
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.0005)  # Reduced learning rate for finer updates
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

history = model.fit(datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32),  # Data augmentation
