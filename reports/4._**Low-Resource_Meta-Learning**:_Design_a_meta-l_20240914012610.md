# Experiment Report: 4. **Low-Resource Meta-Learning**: Design a meta-l

## Idea
4. **Low-Resource Meta-Learning**: Design a meta-learning framework that can be efficiently trained on a single GPU. This framework should be capable of quickly adapting to new tasks with limited data by leveraging shared knowledge from previously learned tasks, thereby improving the overall adaptability and performance of AI models.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Low-Resource Meta-Learning Framework

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to design and validate a meta-learning framework that can be efficiently trained on a single GPU. The framework should be capable of quickly adapting to new tasks using limited data by leveraging shared knowledge from previously learned tasks. The ultimate goal is to improve the overall adaptability and performance of AI models in low-resource settings.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Framework Selection**:
   - Select a suitable meta-learning algorithm such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) or Prototypical Networks.
   - Implement the chosen algorithm with modifications to ensure it can be trained efficiently on a single GPU.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Utilize a variety of datasets to simulate different tasks. Each dataset will represent a task, and subsets of these datasets will be used for meta-training and meta-testing.
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to simulate low-resource scenarios.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the meta-learning framework on multiple tasks to enable the model to learn shared knowledge.
   - Fine-tune the model on new tasks with limited data to evaluate its adaptability.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Measure the performance of the model on new tasks using predefined evaluation metrics.
   - Compare the performance with baseline models trained from scratch on the same tasks.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Meta-Training Datasets**:
  - **Omniglot**: A dataset designed for one-shot learning tasks.
