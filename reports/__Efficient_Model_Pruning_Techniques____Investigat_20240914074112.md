# Experiment Report: **Efficient Model Pruning Techniques:** Investigat

## Idea
**Efficient Model Pruning Techniques:** Investigate a lightweight model pruning technique that selectively removes redundant neurons or layers in neural networks without significant loss in accuracy. The project could involve creating a heuristic-based pruning algorithm that can be tested on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Model Pruning Techniques

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and validate a lightweight model pruning technique that can selectively remove redundant neurons or layers in neural networks with minimal impact on model accuracy. The goal is to create a heuristic-based pruning algorithm that can be efficiently executed on a single GPU, thus improving the AI Research System's performance in terms of both speed and resource utilization.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**: Develop a heuristic-based pruning algorithm. This algorithm will use a combination of layer-wise and neuron-wise pruning criteria based on parameters such as weight magnitude, activation statistics, and contribution to the loss function.

2. **Baseline Model Training**: Train several baseline models on the selected datasets to establish benchmark performance metrics.

3. **Pruning Implementation**: Apply the developed pruning algorithm to the trained models. This involves:
   - Identifying and ranking neurons or layers based on the pruning criteria.
   - Removing the identified redundant neurons or layers.
   - Fine-tuning the pruned model to recover any potential loss in accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the pruned models with the baseline models using predefined evaluation metrics. Performance will be measured in terms of accuracy, inference time, and model size.

5. **Iteration and Optimization**: Iterate over different pruning thresholds and fine-tuning strategies to optimize the trade-off between model compactness and accuracy.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets, available on Hugging Face Datasets, will be used for training and evaluation:
   - **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification with 50,000 movie reviews.
   - **GLUE Benchmark**: A collection of resources for training, evaluating, and analyzing natural language understanding systems.
   - **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits for image classification tasks.

#### 4. Model Architecture
The following model architectures will be used to test the pruning techniques:
   - **ResNet-18**: For image classification tasks on CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
   - **BERT-base**: For natural language understanding tasks on the GLUE Benchmark and IMDB Reviews.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be considered:
   - **Learning Rate**: 0.001 for initial training, 0.0001 for fine-tuning pruned models.
   - **Batch Size**: 64 for CIFAR-10 and MNIST, 32 for IMDB Reviews and GLUE tasks.
   - **Pruning Threshold**: 0.1 (10% of neurons/layers removed), 0.2, 0.3, etc.
   - **Epochs**: 50 for initial training, 20 for fine-tuning.
   - **Optimizer**: Adam
   - **Weight Decay**: 0.0001
   - **Dropout Rate**: 0.5 (if applicable)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
   - **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
   - **Inference Time**: The time taken to make predictions on a fixed validation set.
   - **Model Size**: The number of parameters in the model, measured in megabytes (MB).
   - **F1 Score**: For binary classification tasks, to measure the balance between precision and recall.
   - **Loss**: The loss value on the validation set to monitor overfitting and fine-tuning effectiveness.

This detailed experiment plan aims to systematically test and validate the efficiency of the proposed model pruning techniques, ensuring that the AI Research System can achieve better performance with reduced computational resources.
