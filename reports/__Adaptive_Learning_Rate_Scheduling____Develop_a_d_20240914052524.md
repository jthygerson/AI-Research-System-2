# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling**: Develop a d

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling**: Develop a dynamic learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate based on the model's real-time performance metrics during training. This scheduler would use a small neural network to predict the optimal learning rate for the next epoch, potentially reducing training time and improving model accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling (ALRS) mechanism in improving the performance of AI models. Specifically, we aim to determine whether using a small neural network to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on real-time performance metrics can reduce training time and enhance model accuracy compared to traditional learning rate schedules.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Experimental Setup**:
   - Develop a small neural network that predicts the optimal learning rate for the next epoch based on real-time performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).
   - Implement the ALRS mechanism in the training loop of a machine learning model.
   - Compare the performance of models trained with ALRS against models trained with standard learning rate schedulers, such as StepLR, ExponentialLR, and ReduceLROnPlateau.

2. **Steps**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess datasets.
   - **Model Development**: Implement the baseline model and the ALRS-enhanced model.
   - **Training**: Train models with traditional learning rate schedulers and the ALRS mechanism.
   - **Evaluation**: Assess training time, model accuracy, and convergence speed.

3. **Control Variables**:
   - Use the same model architecture and initial hyperparameters for all experiments.
   - Ensure consistent training and evaluation protocols across all models.

4. **Data Logging**:
   - Log performance metrics, learning rates, and training times for each epoch.
   - Use visualization tools to compare learning curves and performance metrics.

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to train the model for the specified number of epochs.
- **Model Accuracy**: Accuracy of the model on the validation/test set.
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required for the model to reach a predefined performance threshold (e.g., 90% accuracy).
- **Loss**: Final loss value on the validation/test set.
- **Learning Rate Stability**: Variation in learning rates predicted by the ALRS mechanism.

### Execution Plan
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load CIFAR-10, IMDB, and Titanic datasets using Hugging Face Datasets or Kaggle API.
   - Split datasets into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Implement the baseline models for each dataset.
   - Develop the ALRS neural network and integrate it into the training loop.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the models using traditional learning rate schedulers (StepLR, ExponentialLR, ReduceLROnPlateau).
   - Train the models using the ALRS mechanism.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models on the validation/test sets and record the metrics.
   - Compare the performance of ALRS with traditional learning rate schedulers.

5. **Analysis**:
   - Analyze the training time, model accuracy, convergence speed, and learning rate stability.
   - Visualize the learning curves and performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of ALRS.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to determine whether the Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling mechanism can significantly enhance the performance of AI models in terms of training efficiency and accuracy.
