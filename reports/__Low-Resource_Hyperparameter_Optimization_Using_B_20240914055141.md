# Experiment Report: **Low-Resource Hyperparameter Optimization Using B

## Idea
**Low-Resource Hyperparameter Optimization Using Bayesian Methods**: Implement a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning that is specifically optimized for low-resource environments. The aim would be to use fewer iterations and less computational power while still finding near-optimal hyperparameters for smaller models or specific tasks.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Bayesian optimization framework specifically designed for hyperparameter tuning in low-resource environments. The aim is to determine if this method can identify near-optimal hyperparameters with fewer iterations and less computational power compared to traditional grid search or random search methods, particularly for smaller models or specific tasks.

### 2. Methodology

1. **Bayesian Optimization Framework**: Implement a Bayesian optimization framework such as the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) using libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt.

2. **Baselines**: Compare the performance of Bayesian Optimization with traditional methods like Grid Search and Random Search.

3. **Experimental Setup**:
   - **Phase 1**: Initial exploration using a small subset of the dataset to set preliminary hyperparameter ranges.
   - **Phase 2**: Full-scale optimization using the entire dataset and the defined hyperparameter ranges.
   - **Phase 3**: Validation of the selected hyperparameters on an unseen validation set.

4. **Resource Constraints**: Simulate low-resource environments by limiting the computational budget (e.g., number of iterations, CPU/GPU time).

5. **Reproducibility**: Ensure that all experiments are reproducible by setting random seeds and documenting all configurations.

### 3. Datasets

1. **AG News**: A dataset for text classification available on Hugging Face Datasets.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset for image classification tasks.
3. **IMDb**: A dataset for sentiment analysis available on Hugging Face Datasets.

### 4. Model Architecture

1. **Text Classification**: DistilBERT model for AG News.
2. **Image Classification**: ResNet-18 model for CIFAR-10.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: LSTM-based model for IMDb dataset.

### 5. Hyperparameters

- **Text Classification (DistilBERT)**:
  - Learning Rate: (1e-5, 1e-3)
  - Batch Size: [16, 32, 64]
  - Epochs: [2, 3, 4]
  - Dropout Rate: (0.1, 0.5)

- **Image Classification (ResNet-18)**:
  - Learning Rate: (1e-4, 1e-2)
  - Batch Size: [32, 64, 128]
  - Epochs: [10, 20, 30]
  - Weight Decay: (1e-5, 1e-3)

- **Sentiment Analysis (LSTM)**:
  - Learning Rate: (1e-4, 1e-2)
  - Batch Size: [32, 64, 128]
  - Epochs: [5, 10, 15]
  - Hidden Layer Size: [128, 256, 512]

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
2. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
3. **Runtime**: The total computational time taken for hyperparameter optimization.
4. **Number of Iterations**: The number of iterations required to reach near-optimal hyperparameters.

### Execution Plan

1. **Initial Setup**: Configure the Bayesian optimization framework and set up the computational environment.
2. **Dataset Preparation**: Download and preprocess the datasets from Hugging Face Datasets.
3. **Model Initialization**: Initialize the specified model architectures for each dataset.
4. **Baseline Measurement**: Run Grid Search and Random Search to establish baseline performance metrics.
5. **Bayesian Optimization**: Execute Bayesian optimization under the defined resource constraints.
6. **Validation and Analysis**: Compare the performance metrics of Bayesian optimization with the baselines. Analyze the trade-offs between computational resource usage and optimization performance.
7. **Reporting**: Document the findings, including the best hyperparameter sets found, the number of iterations, computational time, and evaluation metrics.
