# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules with Meta-Learn

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules with Meta-Learning**: Create a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rate schedules based on real-time performance metrics of the training process. The algorithm should be lightweight and require minimal additional computation, leveraging a small neural network to predict optimal learning rates.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedules with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rate schedules based on real-time performance metrics during the training process. The hypothesis is that this adaptive learning rate strategy will lead to improved model performance and faster convergence compared to traditional fixed or predefined learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Meta-Learning Algorithm Design**:
   - Develop a small neural network (meta-learner) that predicts optimal learning rates based on current performance metrics such as loss, accuracy, and gradient norms.
   - The meta-learner will be trained using a supervised approach where the input features are the performance metrics and the target is the optimal learning rate.

2. **Training Process**:
   - Implement the meta-learning algorithm within the training loop of a primary model.
   - During each training epoch, collect performance metrics and use the meta-learner to adjust the learning rate dynamically.

3. **Control Group**:
   - Train the same primary model using standard learning rate schedules (fixed, step decay, etc.) to serve as a baseline for comparison.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of the primary model trained with the adaptive learning rate schedule against the baseline models using predefined evaluation metrics.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used image classification dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A sentiment analysis dataset consisting of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each 28x28 pixels.

Datasets are available on [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Primary Model for CIFAR-10**: ResNet-18
- **Primary Model for IMDB**: Bidirectional LSTM
- **Primary Model for MNIST**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **Meta-Learner**: Small feedforward neural network with the following architecture:
  - Input Layer: Size equal to the number of performance metrics.
  - Hidden Layer 1: Fully connected layer with 64 neurons, ReLU activation.
  - Hidden Layer 2: Fully connected layer with 32 neurons, ReLU activation.
  - Output Layer: Single neuron with a linear activation function to predict the learning rate.

#### 5. Hyperparameters

  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 50
  - Optimizer: Adam
- CNN (for MNIST):
  - Learning Rate: 0.001 (initial)

  - Epochs: 20
  - Optimizer: Adam

Meta-Learner:
- Learning Rate: 0.0001
- Batch Size: 32
- Epochs: 100

```

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure the proportion of correctly classified samples.
- **Loss**: Compute the cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
- **Convergence Speed**: Measure the number of epochs required to achieve a certain accuracy threshold.
- **Learning Rate Stability**: Assess the variance in learning rates predicted by the meta-learner over epochs.
- **Computational Overhead**: Evaluate the additional computation time introduced by the meta-learning algorithm.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the hypothesis that adaptive learning rate schedules with meta-learning can lead to better model performance and faster convergence in various AI/ML tasks.
