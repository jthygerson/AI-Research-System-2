### Experiment Plan: Efficient Data Augmentation Techniques for Limited Resources

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of various data augmentation techniques in improving the performance of AI models when limited computational resources and data are available. Specifically, we aim to investigate whether these techniques can enhance model accuracy and generalizability without significantly increasing computational overhead.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1:** Select a baseline model.
- **Step 2:** Train the baseline model on a limited dataset without any data augmentation to establish a performance baseline.
- **Step 3:** Apply different data augmentation techniques to the same limited dataset.
- **Step 4:** Train identical models on the augmented datasets.
- **Step 5:** Compare the performance of models trained on augmented data with the baseline model.
- **Step 6:** Evaluate the computational efficiency of each augmentation technique.

Data Augmentation Techniques to be Tested:
1. Random Cropping
2. Horizontal and Vertical Flips
3. Rotation and Translation
4. Color Jitter
5. Mixup and CutMix
6. Synthetic Data Generation

#### 3. Datasets
Selected datasets from Hugging Face Datasets:
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Baseline Model:** ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10 and a simple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for Fashion MNIST.
- **Augmented Models:** The same architectures as used in the baseline model.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Common hyperparameters for both datasets and models:
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Weight Decay:** 0.0001
- **Momentum:** 0.9 (if using SGD)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified samples over the total number of samples.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall to account for imbalanced classes.
- **Training Time:** Total time taken to complete the training process.
- **Memory Usage:** Peak memory usage during training to assess computational efficiency.
- **Inference Time:** Time taken to make predictions on the test set.

By carefully following this experimental plan, we aim to identify which data augmentation techniques provide the best trade-off between improved model performance and computational efficiency, particularly under constrained resources.

## Code Changes

### File: train.py
**Original Code:**
```python
model = Model()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
num_epochs = 1
batch_size = 32
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
from transformers import get_linear_schedule_with_warmup

model = Model()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005)  # Reduced learning rate
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

num_epochs = 3  # Increased number of epochs
batch_size = 64  # Increased batch size

# Adding a learning rate scheduler
total_steps = len(train_dataloader) * num_epochs
scheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=0, num_training_steps=total_steps)

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        inputs, labels = batch
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()  # Update the learning rate
```

## Conclusion
Based on the experiment results and benchmarking, the AI Research System has been updated to improve its performance.
