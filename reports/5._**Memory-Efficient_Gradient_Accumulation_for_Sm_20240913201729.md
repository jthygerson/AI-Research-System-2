# Experiment Report: 5. **Memory-Efficient Gradient Accumulation for Sm

## Idea
5. **Memory-Efficient Gradient Accumulation for Small Batch Sizes**: Propose a memory-efficient gradient accumulation method that allows the use of smaller batch sizes without sacrificing model performance. This technique would involve a streamlined way to aggregate gradients over multiple iterations, enabling training on limited GPU memory without compromising on the quality of the model updates.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Memory-Efficient Gradient Accumulation for Small Batch Sizes

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to design and test a memory-efficient gradient accumulation method that allows training with smaller batch sizes without sacrificing model performance. The specific goals are:
- To verify that the proposed method can reduce memory consumption.
- To ensure that the quality of the model updates remains uncompromised.
- To evaluate the method's impact on training time and model accuracy.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will be conducted in the following steps:

1. **Baseline Setup**:
   - Train a model using standard gradient accumulation with a large batch size.
   - Record memory usage, training time, and performance metrics.

2. **Proposed Method Implementation**:
   - Develop the memory-efficient gradient accumulation method.
   - Integrate it into the training loop to accumulate gradients over multiple iterations while using smaller batch sizes.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Train the same model using the proposed method with smaller batch sizes.
   - Record memory usage, training time, and performance metrics.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Compare the performance metrics, memory consumption, and training time between the baseline and the proposed method.
   - Perform statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used for the experiment:

1. **Image Classification**:
   - CIFAR-10: `hf:datasets/cifar10`
   - ImageNet: `hf:datasets/imagenet`

2. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - GLUE Benchmark: `hf:datasets/glue`
   - SQuAD: `hf:datasets/squad`

#### 4. Model Architecture
The experiment will be conducted on the following model types:

1. **Image Classification**:
   - ResNet-50: A deep residual network suitable for image classification tasks.
   - EfficientNet-B0: A more memory-efficient model for image classification.

2. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - BERT-base: A transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of English data.
   - RoBERTa-base: An optimized version of BERT with improved training strategies.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be used in the experiment:

- **Learning Rate**: `2e-5`
- **Batch Size**: 
  - Baseline: `64` (large batch size)
  - Proposed Method: `8` (small batch size)
- **Gradient Accumulation Steps**:
  - Baseline: `1` (no accumulation)
  - Proposed Method: `8` (to match effective batch size with baseline)
- **Number of Epochs**: `10`
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Weight Decay**: `0.01`
- **Warmup Steps**: `500`
- **Max Grad Norm**: `1.0`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following evaluation metrics will be used to assess the performance of the models:

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - Peak GPU memory consumption during training.

2. **Training Time**:
   - Total time taken for training the model.

3. **Model Performance**:
   - Image Classification:
     - Accuracy
     - Top-5 Accuracy (for ImageNet)
   - Natural Language Processing:
     - Accuracy (for classification tasks in GLUE)
     - F1 Score (for SQuAD)

4. **Gradient Consistency**:
   - Cosine similarity between accumulated gradients and direct gradients (to ensure that gradient accumulation does not diverge).

### Conclusion
