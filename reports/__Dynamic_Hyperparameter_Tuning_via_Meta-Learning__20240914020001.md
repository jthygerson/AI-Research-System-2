# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning*

## Idea
**Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning**: Develop a lightweight meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters during training based on real-time performance metrics. This approach could reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter searches by leveraging past training runs to inform new ones.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a dynamic hyperparameter tuning mechanism using a lightweight meta-learning algorithm. The goal is to dynamically adjust hyperparameters during the training process based on real-time performance metrics, thereby reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter searches and potentially improving model performance and training efficiency.

#### 2. Methodology

**Step 1: Baseline Setup**
- Train several baseline models with a fixed set of hyperparameters using a conventional grid search or random search method.
- Record the performance metrics of these baseline models.

**Step 2: Meta-Learning Algorithm Development**
- Develop a lightweight meta-learning algorithm that can dynamically adjust hyperparameters during the training process.
- The meta-learner will be trained on historical data from past training runs, learning to predict optimal hyperparameter adjustments based on real-time performance metrics.

**Step 3: Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Integrate the meta-learning algorithm into the training loop of the primary model.
- During training, allow the meta-learner to dynamically adjust the hyperparameters based on the observed performance metrics.

**Step 4: Comparative Analysis**
- Compare the performance of models trained with dynamic hyperparameter tuning against the baseline models.
- Analyze the efficiency gains in terms of reduced training time and improved model performance.

#### 3. Datasets

We will use a variety of datasets from Hugging Face Datasets to ensure the generalizability of the results. The selected datasets include:
- **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) Benchmark**: A collection of datasets for evaluating natural language understanding systems.
- **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**: Image classification datasets consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 and 100 classes, respectively.
- **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.

#### 4. Model Architecture

We will use different model architectures to test the effectiveness of the dynamic hyperparameter tuning:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-50 (Residual Networks)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks

#### 5. Hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters will be dynamically tuned using the meta-learning algorithm:
- **Learning Rate**: Initial value, decay rate
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples per gradient update
- **Momentum**: For optimization algorithms like SGD
- **Dropout Rate**: For regularization in neural networks
- **Weight Decay**: For regularization in optimization algorithms
- **Number of Layers**: Specifically for LSTM and other deep architectures

Example initial hyperparameters:
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Batch Size: 32
- Momentum: 0.9
- Dropout Rate: 0.5
- Weight Decay: 0.0001
- Number of Layers: 2

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to train the model.
- **Validation Loss**: Loss on the validation set to monitor overfitting.
- **Learning Efficiency**: Improvement in performance relative to the number of training epochs.

**Additional Metrics for Analysis**:
- **Hyperparameter Stability**: Frequency and magnitude of hyperparameter adjustments during training.
- **Resource Utilization**: Computational resources (CPU/GPU usage, memory consumption) required for dynamic tuning versus static tuning.

By following this detailed experiment plan, we aim to determine whether dynamic hyperparameter tuning via meta-learning can effectively improve the performance and efficiency of AI/ML models across different tasks and datasets.
