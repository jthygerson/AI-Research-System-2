# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization with Meta

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization with Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on the model’s performance over small epochs. This can be done using a single GPU by training the meta-learner on a smaller, representative subset of the data to predict optimal learning rates for various stages of training.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on the model’s performance over small epochs. The goal is to improve the overall training efficiency and final performance of the AI model by optimizing the learning rate in a more adaptive and data-driven manner.

### 2. Methodology
To achieve this, we will follow these steps:
1. **Meta-Learner Design**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that predicts optimal learning rates for various stages of model training.
2. **Training Procedure**:
   - Train the primary AI model on a large dataset using a single GPU.
   - Simultaneously, train the meta-learner on a smaller, representative subset of the data to predict learning rates.
3. **Meta-Learning Loop**: Within each small epoch of the primary model, use the meta-learner to adjust the learning rate dynamically based on the model's performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).
4. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the model trained with adaptive learning rates against a baseline model trained with traditional fixed or decaying learning rates.

### 3. Datasets
We will use the following datasets, available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- **Primary Model Dataset**: 
  - **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks.
  - Source: [Hugging Face - CIFAR-10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)
- **Meta-Learner Dataset**: 
  - **CIFAR-10 Subset**: A smaller, representative subset (e.g., 10% of the original CIFAR-10 dataset) to train the meta-learner.
  - Source: [Hugging Face - CIFAR-10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Primary Model**: 
  - **ResNet-18**: A convolutional neural network architecture commonly used for image classification tasks.
  - Source: [Hugging Face - ResNet](https://huggingface.co/models?search=resnet)

- **Meta-Learner**: 
  - **Simple Feedforward Neural Network**: A small neural network with a few dense layers to predict learning rates.
  - Architecture Details:
    - Input Layer: Performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).
    - Hidden Layers: 2-3 dense layers with ReLU activation.
    - Output Layer: Single neuron with linear activation to predict the learning rate.

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

- **Comparison Metrics**:
  - Compare the primary model trained with adaptive learning rates against a baseline model with fixed or decaying learning rates in terms of:
    - `Final Test Accuracy`.
    - `Final Test Loss`.
    - `Convergence Speed`: Number of epochs to reach 95% of the final accuracy.
