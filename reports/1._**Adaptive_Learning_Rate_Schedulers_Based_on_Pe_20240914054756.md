# Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Performance Metrics

## 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate schedulers that dynamically adjust the learning rate based on real-time performance metrics. The goal is to determine whether these adaptive schedulers can improve the convergence speed and overall performance of machine learning models compared to traditional fixed or pre-defined learning rate schedules.

## 2. Methodology
### Experiment Design
1. **Baseline Model Training**: Train models using traditional learning rate schedules such as constant learning rate, step decay, and cosine annealing.
2. **Adaptive Scheduler Training**: Train the same models using adaptive learning rate schedulers that adjust based on real-time performance metrics such as validation loss, accuracy, or other relevant metrics.
3. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of both approaches in terms of convergence speed, final accuracy, and other evaluation metrics.

### Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler Implementation
- The adaptive scheduler will monitor performance metrics at the end of each epoch.
- The learning rate will be adjusted based on predefined rules or a machine learning model trained to predict the optimal learning rate adjustments.

### Steps
1. Split datasets into training and validation sets.
2. Train models with traditional learning rate schedulers.
3. Train models with adaptive learning rate schedulers.
4. Evaluate and compare the results.

## 3. Datasets
We will use a variety of datasets to ensure the generalizability of the experiment:

1. **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
2. **Text Classification**: IMDB Reviews (available on Hugging Face Datasets)
3. **Natural Language Processing**: SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) (available on Hugging Face Datasets)

## 4. Model Architecture
We will utilize a combination of popular model architectures to cover different types of tasks:

1. **Image Classification**: 
   - ResNet-50
   - EfficientNet-B0

2. **Text Classification**:
   - BERT (Base, Uncased)
   - RoBERTa (Base)

3. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - LSTM
   - Transformer

## 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters for each model will be set as follows:

### ResNet-50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50

### EfficientNet-B0
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50

### BERT (Base, Uncased)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 2e-5
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 3

### RoBERTa (Base)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 1e-5
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 3

### LSTM
- **Hidden Units**: 128
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 20

### Transformer
- **Number of Layers**: 6
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.0001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 20

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the models, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
2. **Validation Loss**: Cross-entropy loss on the validation set.
3. **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a certain threshold of validation accuracy or loss.
4. **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
5. **Learning Rate Behavior**: Analyze how the learning rate changes over epochs and its correlation with model performance.

### Additional Considerations
- **Statistical Significance**: Perform statistical tests to confirm that observed differences are significant.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that the experiment can be replicated by using fixed random seeds and clear documentation.

By following this detailed experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the hypothesis that adaptive learning rate schedulers based on performance metrics can enhance the performance and efficiency of AI research systems.
