## Idea
2. **Efficient Pruning Techniques**: Investigate a novel, computationally inexpensive pruning method that selectively removes less important neurons and connections during training to reduce model size without significant loss of accuracy. The emphasis would be on creating a pruning strategy that can be easily integrated into existing training routines and evaluated within a week.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Pruning Techniques in AI/ML

#### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate a novel, computationally inexpensive pruning method that selectively removes less important neurons and connections during training. The goal is to reduce the model size without significant loss of accuracy, while ensuring the pruning strategy can be easily integrated into existing training routines and evaluated within a week.

#### 2. Methodology

1. **Pruning Technique**: Develop a pruning algorithm that operates during the training phase. The pruning will be based on the magnitude of weights and gradients, selectively removing those with the least contribution to the model's performance.
   - **Initial Pruning**: At predefined intervals during training, identify and prune a small percentage of neurons and connections with the lowest weights/gradients.
   - **Dynamic Adjustment**: As training progresses, dynamically adjust the pruning rate based on the model's performance.
   - **Re-training**: After each pruning phase, allow the model some epochs to retrain and recover from the pruning.

2. **Integration**: Implement the pruning strategy within the training loop of a commonly used deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).

3. **Baseline Comparison**: Train identical models with and without pruning to compare performance, size, and training time.

#### 3. Datasets

Select datasets from the Hugging Face Datasets library that are well-established in the AI/ML community for benchmarking:

- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10
- **Text Classification**: IMDB Reviews
- **Tabular Data**: Titanic Dataset

#### 4. Model Architecture

Choose representative model architectures for each dataset to ensure the pruning method's generalizability:

- **CIFAR-10**: ResNet-18
- **IMDB Reviews**: BERT (base-uncased)
- **Titanic Dataset**: Fully Connected Neural Network (3 layers)

#### 5. Hyperparameters

Define the hyperparameters for training, including those specific to the pruning strategy:

- **Common Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning Rate: `0.001`
  - Batch Size: `32`
  - Epochs: `50`
  - Optimizer: `Adam`

- **Pruning-Specific Hyperparameters**:
  - Initial Pruning Rate: `0.1` (10% of neurons/connections)
  - Pruning Interval: `5` epochs
  - Minimum Weight Threshold: `0.01`
  - Gradient Magnitude Threshold: `0.001`
  - Dynamic Adjustment Factor: `0.05` (adjust pruning rate based on performance degradation or improvement)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate the performance of the models using the following metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment:

- **Accuracy**: Measure the overall accuracy of the model on the validation set.
- **Model Size**: Compare the number of parameters before and after pruning.
- **Training Time**: Record the total training time for models with and without pruning.
- **Inference Time**: Measure the time taken for a single forward pass on the validation set.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and compare the memory usage during training and inference.
- **Loss**: Track the training and validation loss to ensure that pruning does not lead to significant overfitting or underfitting.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed pruning technique in reducing model size and computational requirements while maintaining competitive performance.
