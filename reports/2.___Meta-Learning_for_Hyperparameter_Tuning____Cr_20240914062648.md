# Experiment Report: 2. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning:** Cr

## Idea
2. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning:** Create a meta-learning framework that automates the process of hyperparameter tuning by learning from previous tuning experiments. This can significantly reduce the time and computational cost associated with finding optimal hyperparameters for new models.

## Experiment Plan
## 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate a meta-learning framework that automates the process of hyperparameter tuning by learning from previous tuning experiments. The aim is to significantly reduce the time and computational cost associated with finding optimal hyperparameters for new models.

## 2. Methodology
### Overview
The experiment will be conducted in two phases: 
1. **Training the Meta-Learning Model**: A meta-learning model will be trained on a diverse set of previous hyperparameter tuning experiments.
2. **Evaluating the Meta-Learning Model**: The trained meta-learning model will be used to suggest hyperparameters for new ML models, and its performance will be compared against traditional hyperparameter tuning methods.

### Phase 1: Training the Meta-Learning Model
1. **Data Collection**: Collect data from previous hyperparameter tuning experiments, including the model type, dataset, and performance metrics.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the collected data, such as model architecture, dataset characteristics, and the associated hyperparameters.
3. **Model Training**: Train a meta-learning model (e.g., a neural network or a gradient-boosted decision tree) using the collected and engineered features.

### Phase 2: Evaluating the Meta-Learning Model
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Perform traditional hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search or Random Search) on new ML models and record the performance.
2. **Meta-Learning Application**: Use the trained meta-learning model to suggest hyperparameters for the same ML models and record the performance.
3. **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare the performance metrics and time taken for both methods.

## 3. Datasets
### Training Phase
- **OpenML-CC18**: A collection of datasets used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Various datasets from different domains.

### Evaluation Phase
- **IMDb** (Hugging Face Datasets): For text classification tasks.
- **CIFAR-10** (Hugging Face Datasets): For image classification tasks.
- **Wine Quality** (Hugging Face Datasets): For regression tasks.

## 4. Model Architecture
### Meta-Learning Model
- **Neural Network**: Multi-layer perceptron with input features derived from previous tuning experiments.
- **Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees**: XGBoost model trained on features from previous tuning experiments.

### Target ML Models
- **Text Classification**: BERT-based models.
- **Image Classification**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet.
- **Regression**: Random Forest Regressor.

## 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters to be tuned will vary based on the model type. Here are some examples:

### BERT-Based Models (Text Classification)
- `learning_rate`: [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4]
- `batch_size`: [16, 32, 64]
- `num_train_epochs`: [3, 4, 5]

### CNNs (Image Classification)
- `learning_rate`: [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]
- `batch_size`: [32, 64, 128]
- `num_epochs`: [10, 20, 30]
- `dropout_rate`: [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]

### Random Forest Regressor (Regression)
- `n_estimators`: [50, 100, 200]
- `max_depth`: [None, 10, 20, 30]
- `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10]

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: For classification tasks.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: For regression tasks.
- **F1 Score**: For classification tasks with imbalanced datasets.

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Time Taken**: Total time taken for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Computational Cost**: Measured in terms of GPU/CPU hours consumed.

### Comparison Metrics
- **Relative Improvement**: Improvement in performance metrics when using meta-learning over traditional methods.
- **Reduction in Time/Cost**: Percentage reduction in time and computational cost when using meta-learning.

By following this experimental design, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of meta-learning in automating and improving the hyperparameter tuning process in machine learning models.
