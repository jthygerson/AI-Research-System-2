# Experiment Report: **Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization via Bayesi

## Idea
**Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization via Bayesian Optimization with Meta-Learning**: Investigate a hybrid approach that combines Bayesian optimization with meta-learning to rapidly tune hyperparameters for neural networks. This method aims to leverage past hyperparameter tuning experiences to accelerate the optimization process, optimizing models effectively on a single GPU within a week.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization via Bayesian Optimization with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to investigate the efficacy of a hybrid approach combining Bayesian optimization with meta-learning for rapid hyperparameter tuning of neural networks. Specifically, the study aims to demonstrate that leveraging past hyperparameter tuning experiences can significantly accelerate the optimization process, allowing the optimized models to be trained effectively on a single GPU within a week.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Split each dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70%-15%-15%).
    - Preprocess datasets as required, including normalization, tokenization, and vectorization.

2. **Meta-Learning Phase**:
    - Collect historical hyperparameter tuning data from past experiments on similar datasets and models.
    - Train a meta-learner to predict the performance of hyperparameters based on historical data.
  
3. **Bayesian Optimization Phase**:
    - Initialize Bayesian optimization with priors informed by the meta-learner.
    - Use Gaussian Processes (GP) or Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) as the surrogate model.
    - Iteratively suggest hyperparameters, evaluate model performance, and update the surrogate model.

4. **Optimization Process**:
    - Run the hybrid optimization process for each dataset-model combination.
    - Allocate a maximum of one week of GPU time per dataset-model pair for hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Model Training**:
    - Train each model with the optimized hyperparameters obtained from the hybrid approach.
    - Compare results against baseline models tuned using standard Bayesian optimization without meta-learning.

    - Perform statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to determine the significance of performance improvements.

2. **Resource Utilization**:
    - Measure GPU utilization and time taken for hyperparameter optimization.
