# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Model

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Model Uncertainty**: Develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate based on model uncertainty metrics such as prediction confidence or Bayesian uncertainty estimates. This approach would help in fine-tuning the training process more efficiently, ensuring faster convergence and better performance with fewer epochs.

## Experiment Plan
# Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Model Uncertainty

## 1. Objective
To develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate scheduler that adjusts the learning rate based on model uncertainty metrics such as prediction confidence and Bayesian uncertainty estimates. The goal is to assess whether this approach can lead to faster convergence and improved performance with fewer training epochs compared to traditional learning rate schedules.

## 2. Methodology

### A. Baseline Setup
1. **Baseline Learning Rate Schedulers:** Use standard learning rate schedulers such as constant, step decay, and cosine annealing.
2. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler:** Develop a custom scheduler that adjusts the learning rate based on model uncertainty. 

### B. Model Uncertainty Metrics
1. **Prediction Confidence:** Measure the softmax output for classification tasks.
2. **Bayesian Uncertainty Estimates:** Use dropout at inference time or Bayesian neural networks to estimate uncertainty.

### C. Training Procedure
1. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test subsets.
2. Train models using both baseline and adaptive learning rate schedulers.
3. Monitor training and validation loss, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.
4. Store and compare the performance of models across different epochs.

### D. Uncertainty-based Learning Rate Adjustment
1. **High Uncertainty:** Increase the learning rate to encourage exploration.
2. **Low Uncertainty:** Decrease the learning rate to fine-tune around local minima.

## 3. Datasets
1. **CIFAR-10:** A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **MNIST:** A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.
3. **IMDB Reviews:** A dataset for binary sentiment classification with 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.

Datasets can be sourced from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

## 4. Model Architecture
1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** For image datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
   - Example: ResNet-18, VGG-16
2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) / Transformer:** For text data like IMDB Reviews.
   - Example: LSTM, BERT

## 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Dropout Rate (for Bayesian Uncertainty):** 0.5
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Weight Decay:** 0.0001
- **Uncertainty Threshold (for adaptation):** 0.05 (example value)
- **Step Size (for learning rate adjustment):** 0.1

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correct predictions.
- **Loss:** Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Convergence Speed:** The number of epochs required to reach a certain accuracy threshold.
- **Model Uncertainty:** Average uncertainty measure (prediction confidence or Bayesian estimate) over the validation set.

### A/B Testing
1. Conduct A/B testing between baseline and adaptive learning rate schedulers.
2. Perform statistical tests (e.g., paired t-test) to determine the significance of the results.

### Reporting
1. **Graphs:** Plot learning curves for loss, accuracy, and learning rate over epochs.
2. **Tables:** Summarize final performance metrics, convergence speed, and uncertainty measurements.
3. **Analysis:** Discuss findings, potential reasons for performance differences, and implications for further research.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously evaluate whether adaptive learning rate schedulers based on model uncertainty can enhance training efficiency and model performance in AI/ML tasks.

## Code Changes

### File: train_model.py
**Original Code:**
```python
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=1, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

**Updated Code:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau

# Adding dropout layers to the model architecture
model.add(Dropout(0.5))

# Optimizing learning rate with callbacks
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.0005)
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, restore_best_weights=True)
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2, patience=3, min_lr=1e-6)

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stopping, reduce_lr])
```
