# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning*

## Idea
**Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, etc.) during the training process, rather than relying on static values. This approach could use a small model to predict optimal hyperparameters based on real-time performance metrics, aiming to enhance training efficiency and model performance.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Dynamic Hyperparameter Tuning via Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning algorithm in dynamically adjusting hyperparameters during the training process. This approach aims to improve training efficiency and overall model performance compared to using static hyperparameter values.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Meta-Learner Design**: Develop a meta-learning model (MetaLearner) that predicts optimal hyperparameters based on real-time performance metrics during training. The MetaLearner will be a small neural network trained to map performance metrics (like loss, gradient norms, etc.) to hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size).
  
- **Training Process**:
  1. **Initialization**: Start with initial hyperparameters for the base model.
  2. **Training Loop**:
     - Train the base model for a few epochs using the current hyperparameters.
     - Collect performance metrics (e.g., training loss, validation accuracy).
     - Feed these metrics into the MetaLearner to predict new hyperparameters.
     - Update the base model's hyperparameters and continue training.
  3. **Iteration**: Repeat the training loop, continually adjusting hyperparameters based on the MetaLearner's predictions.

- **Baselines**: Train the same base model using static hyperparameter values (e.g., using grid search or random search to select the best static hyperparameters) for comparison.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10** (`cifar10` from Hugging Face Datasets): A collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB Reviews** (`imdb` from Hugging Face Datasets): A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
- **MNIST** (`mnist` from Hugging Face Datasets): A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits in 10 classes.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: 
  - For CIFAR-10: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers:
    - Convolutional Layer (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, Relu)
    - MaxPooling Layer (2x2)
    - Convolutional Layer (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, Relu)
    - MaxPooling Layer (2x2)
    - Fully Connected Layer (128 units, Relu)
    - Output Layer (10 units, Softmax)

    - Embedding Layer (input_dim=10000, output_dim=128)
    - LSTM Layer (128 units)
    - Fully Connected Layer (128 units, Relu)
    - Output Layer (1 unit, Sigmoid)
  - For MNIST: A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with layers:
    - Fully Connected Layer (512 units, Relu)
    - Dropout Layer (rate=0.2)
    - Fully Connected Layer (512 units, Relu)
    - Dropout Layer (rate=0.2)
    - Output Layer (10 units, Softmax)

- **MetaLearner Model**: 
  - Input Layer (size equals the number of performance metrics)
