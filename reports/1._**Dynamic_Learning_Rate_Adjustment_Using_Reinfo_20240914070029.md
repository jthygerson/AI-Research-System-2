# Experiment Report: 1. **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment Using Reinfo

## Idea
1. **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment Using Reinforcement Learning**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training. The agent would monitor the loss and other metrics to decide the optimal learning rate at each epoch, aiming to speed up convergence and avoid local minima.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment Using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training. The goal is to improve the performance of the neural network by speeding up convergence, avoiding local minima, and achieving better generalization.

#### 2. Methodology
**Step 1: Define the RL Environment**
- **State Space**: The state space will include the current learning rate, the loss, the gradient norm, and other relevant training metrics.
- **Action Space**: The action space will consist of a set of possible adjustments to the learning rate (e.g., increase, decrease, or maintain the current learning rate).
- **Reward Function**: The reward function will be based on the improvement in validation loss or accuracy. A positive reward will be given for improvements, and a negative reward for deteriorations.

**Step 2: Train the RL Agent**
- Use a reinforcement learning algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train the agent.
- The agent will interact with the environment (neural network training process) and learn to adjust the learning rate optimally.

**Step 3: Integrate RL Agent with Neural Network Training**
- During each epoch of neural network training, the RL agent will observe the current state and decide on the learning rate adjustment.
- The neural network will be trained using the adjusted learning rate, and the resulting metrics will be fed back to the RL agent.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Performance**
- Compare the performance of the neural network with dynamic learning rate adjustment to a baseline model trained with a static learning rate schedule.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used for this experiment:

- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (cifar10)
- **Natural Language Processing**: GLUE Benchmark (glue)
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Electricity Load Diagrams (electricity)

#### 4. Model Architecture
For each dataset, a suitable model architecture will be selected:

- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**: ResNet-18
- **Natural Language Processing (GLUE)**: BERT-based classifier
- **Time Series Forecasting (Electricity)**: LSTM-based model

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be used in the experiment:

- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**:
  - Algorithm: PPO
  - Learning Rate: 0.0003
  - Gamma: 0.99
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Number of Epochs: 10

- **Neural Network Training**:
  - Initial Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Learning Rate Adjustments: [×0.1, ×0.5, ×1, ×2, ×10]
  - Batch Size: 128
  - Number of Epochs: 50

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the dynamic learning rate adjustment, the following metrics will be used:

- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a certain validation loss threshold.
- **Final Model Performance**: Best achieved validation accuracy or loss.
- **Generalization**: Performance on a held-out test set.
- **Stability**: Variance in validation loss or accuracy across epochs.

By comparing these metrics between the dynamically adjusted learning rate model and the baseline model, we can assess the effectiveness of the reinforcement learning agent in improving the neural network training process.
