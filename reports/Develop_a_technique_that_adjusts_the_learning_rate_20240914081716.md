# Experiment Report: Develop a technique that adjusts the learning rate

## Idea
Develop a technique that adjusts the learning rate dynamically based on the variability of gradients during training. By analyzing gradient patterns, the system can adaptively modify the learning rate to optimize convergence speed and stability, especially in resource-constrained environments.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan to Test Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment Based on Gradient Variability

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a dynamic learning rate adjustment technique based on the variability of gradients during training. The goal is to determine if this technique can optimize convergence speed and stability, particularly in resource-constrained environments. We will compare this technique against standard learning rate schedules to assess its performance.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess datasets.
- **Step 2: Model Initialization**: Initialize the chosen model architecture.
- **Step 3: Baseline Training**: Train the model using a standard learning rate schedule (e.g., fixed, step decay).
- **Step 4: Dynamic Learning Rate Training**: Train another instance of the same model using the proposed dynamic learning rate adjustment technique.
- **Step 5: Monitoring**: Record metrics such as training loss, validation loss, and accuracy at each epoch, along with the learning rates chosen by the dynamic technique.
- **Step 6: Comparison**: Compare the performance of the two approaches using evaluation metrics.

### Experimental Procedure

#### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Text Classification**: Tokenize and pad sequences for BERT.
   - **Image Classification**: Normalize images and perform data augmentation.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Tokenize and pad sequences for LSTM.

2. **Model Initialization**:
   - Initialize BERT, ResNet-50, and LSTM models with pre-trained weights where applicable.

3. **Baseline Training**:
   - Train each model using a fixed learning rate of 0.001 for 20 epochs.
   - Record the metrics: training loss, validation loss, and accuracy at each epoch.

4. **Dynamic Learning Rate Training**:
   - For each model, calculate gradient variability every 5 batches.
   - Adjust the learning rate dynamically: If gradient variability increases, decrease the learning rate by a factor of 0.1; if it decreases, increase by a factor of 0.1.
   - Train for 20 epochs.
   - Record the metrics: training loss, validation loss, accuracy, and the learning rate at each epoch.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Use TensorBoard or similar tool to visualize the training process, including the learning rate changes over epochs.
   - Maintain detailed logs of gradient variability and learning rate adjustments.

6. **Comparison and Analysis**:
   - Compare the convergence speed by evaluating the number of epochs required to reach a specific validation loss threshold.
   - Assess stability by calculating the standard deviation of the validation loss over the last 5 epochs.
   - Analyze final validation accuracy to determine overall performance.
   - Evaluate resource efficiency by measuring GPU/CPU time and memory usage.

By following this detailed experimental plan, we aim to quantify the benefits of dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on gradient variability, and demonstrate its potential for enhancing training performance in AI/ML models.
