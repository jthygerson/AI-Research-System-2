# Experiment Report: Develop a lightweight Bayesian neural network fram

## Idea
Develop a lightweight Bayesian neural network framework to predict optimal hyperparameters for small-scale AI models. The framework should leverage uncertainty estimation to prioritize hyperparameter configurations that are more likely to yield performance improvements, thereby reducing the number of required training runs.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a lightweight Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework designed to predict optimal hyperparameters for small-scale AI models. By leveraging uncertainty estimation, the framework should prioritize hyperparameter configurations that are more likely to yield performance improvements. This approach aims to reduce the number of required training runs, thereby optimizing computational resources and speeding up the hyperparameter tuning process.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Bayesian Neural Network Framework Development:**
   - Develop a BNN framework to predict the performance of hyperparameter configurations.
   - Incorporate uncertainty estimation to prioritize hyperparameter configurations with the highest potential for performance improvement.

2. **Hyperparameter Space Definition:**
   - Define the hyperparameter space for the AI models.
   - Use the BNN to sample from this space and predict model performance.

3. **Training and Validation:**
   - Train small-scale AI models using the sampled hyperparameter configurations.
   - Validate these models and collect performance metrics.

4. **Iterative Optimization:**
   - Use the performance metrics to update the BNN framework iteratively.
   - Continue the process until convergence or a predefined computational budget is exhausted.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Compare the performance of the AI models tuned using the BNN framework against a baseline (e.g., random search, grid search, or traditional Bayesian optimization).

### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used to train and validate the AI models:
1. **IMDB:** For text classification tasks.
2. **MNIST:** For image classification tasks.
3. **UCI Wine Quality:** For regression tasks.
4. **AG News:** For text classification tasks in a multi-class setting.

### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Text Classification:**
   - Model: Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism
   - Layers: Embedding → BiLSTM → Attention → Dense → Softmax

2. **Image Classification:**
   - Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   - Layers: Conv2D → MaxPooling → Conv2D → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense → Softmax

3. **Regression:**
   - Model: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
   - Layers: Dense → ReLU → Dense → ReLU → Dense

### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters to be optimized and their ranges are as follows:
1. **Text Classification (Bidirectional LSTM):**
   - Learning Rate: [1e-5, 1e-3]
   - Batch Size: [16, 64]
   - Number of LSTM Units: [50, 200]
   - Dropout Rate: [0.2, 0.5]

2. **Image Classification (CNN):**
   - Learning Rate: [1e-4, 1e-2]
   - Batch Size: [32, 128]
   - Number of Filters (Conv Layers): [32, 128]
   - Kernel Size: [3, 5]
   - Dropout Rate: [0.2, 0.5]

3. **Regression (FNN):**
   - Learning Rate: [1e-4, 1e-2]
   - Batch Size: [16, 64]
   - Number of Neurons (Dense Layers): [64, 256]
   - Number of Layers: [2, 4]

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following evaluation metrics will be used to assess the performance of the AI models and the effectiveness of the BNN framework:
1. **Text Classification:**
   - Accuracy
   - F1 Score (macro and micro)

2. **Image Classification:**
   - Accuracy
   - F1 Score (macro and micro)

3. **Regression:**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (R²)

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning Efficiency:**
   - Number of Training Runs
   - Computational Time

By comparing these metrics, we can determine whether the BNN framework effectively reduces the number of required training runs and improves the overall performance of the models.
