# Experiment Report: Develop a learning rate scheduler that dynamically

## Idea
Develop a learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) during training. This adaptive scheduler would use simple heuristics or lightweight reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize the learning rate for faster convergence and better model generalization.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics, such as loss and accuracy. The goal is to determine whether this adaptive scheduler can achieve faster convergence and better model generalization compared to traditional static or pre-defined learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Develop the Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler**:
    - Implement a learning rate scheduler that uses feedback from performance metrics.
    - Two approaches will be tested: (a) simple heuristics and (b) lightweight reinforcement learning algorithms.
  
2. **Training Procedure**:
    - Split datasets into training, validation, and test sets.
    - Train models using the adaptive learning rate scheduler.
    - Compare results with models using static learning rate schedules (e.g., fixed, step decay, cosine annealing).

3. **Feedback Mechanism**:
    - Monitor performance metrics (loss, accuracy) during training.
    - Adjust the learning rate based on observed trends:
        - Increase learning rate if loss decreases significantly.
        - Decrease learning rate if loss plateaus or increases.
    - For reinforcement learning-based scheduler, use reward signals based on improvements in validation performance.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `cifar10`, `cifar100`)
- **Natural Language Processing**: IMDB Reviews (sentiment analysis, available on Hugging Face Datasets: `imdb`)
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Electricity Consumption (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `electricity`)

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: 
    - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as ResNet-18 and VGG-16.
- **Natural Language Processing**: 
    - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures such as LSTM and transformer-based models like BERT.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: 
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.01
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Static Learning Rate Schedules**:
    - Fixed: 0.001
    - Step Decay: Drop by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs
    - Cosine Annealing: Minimum learning rate of 1e-6

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs to reach a predefined threshold of validation accuracy or loss.
- **Final Model Performance**: 
    - Accuracy (for image classification and NLP tasks)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) (for time series forecasting)
- **Generalization**: Performance gap between training and validation sets. 
- **Training Stability**: Variability in loss/accuracy during training.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to systematically evaluate whether the proposed adaptive learning rate scheduler can outperform traditional methods in terms of convergence speed, final model performance, and generalization capability.
