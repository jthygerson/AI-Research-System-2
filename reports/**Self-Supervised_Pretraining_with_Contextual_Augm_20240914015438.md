# Experiment Report: **Self-Supervised Pretraining with Contextual Augm

## Idea
**Self-Supervised Pretraining with Contextual Augmentation**: Create a self-supervised learning framework that uses contextual data augmentation to pretrain models. By generating various augmented versions of the input data and using them to predict certain aspects of the original data, the model can learn more robust features. This approach can improve downstream task performance with minimal labeled data.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-supervised learning framework with contextual data augmentation for pretraining models. Specifically, we aim to determine if this approach improves downstream task performance compared to traditional pretraining methods, particularly in scenarios with minimal labeled data.

### 2. Methodology

**Step 1: Contextual Data Augmentation:**
- Generate various augmented versions of the input data by applying transformations such as cropping, flipping, rotation, jittering, and color adjustments (for images), or masking, shuffling, and substituting words (for text).

**Step 2: Self-Supervised Pretraining:**
- Train the models on these augmented datasets to predict certain aspects of the original data (e.g., predicting the original image from its augmented versions or reconstructing the original text).

**Step 3: Downstream Task Training:**
- Fine-tune the pretrained models on labeled data for specific downstream tasks (e.g., image classification, text classification).

**Step 4: Evaluation:**
- Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models on downstream tasks and compare it with models pretrained without contextual augmentation.

### 3. Datasets

**Image Datasets:**
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **ImageNet**: A larger dataset with over 14 million images classified into 1,000 categories. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.

**Text Datasets:**
- **IMDB Reviews**: A collection of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **AG News**: A news topic classification dataset with 120,000 training samples and 7,600 test samples. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.

### 4. Model Architecture

**Image Models:**
- **ResNet-50**: A residual neural network with 50 layers, commonly used for image classification tasks.
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: An architecture that applies transformer models to image classification.

**Text Models:**
- **BERT (Base)**: A transformer-based model designed for NLP tasks, pretrained on a large corpus of text.
- **GPT-3 (Small variant)**: A smaller version of the GPT-3 model designed for text generation and classification tasks.

### 5. Hyperparameters

- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Number of Epochs:** 50
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Weight Decay:** 0.0001
- **Augmentation Probability:** 0.5 (probability of applying each augmentation)
- **Masking Ratio (for text):** 0.15 (percentage of tokens to mask for text models)
- **Dropout Rate:** 0.2

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

**For Image Tasks:**
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, used for imbalanced datasets.
- **Top-1 and Top-5 Accuracy:** Measures the model's ability to correctly classify the top 1 and top 5 predictions.

**For Text Tasks:**
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases.
- **F1 Score (Macro and Micro):** Macro-average gives equal weight to each class, while micro-average gives equal weight to each instance.
- **Perplexity (for language models):** Measures the model's ability to predict the next word in a sequence.

### Experimental Procedure

1. **Data Preparation:** Obtain and preprocess the datasets from Hugging Face Datasets.
2. **Augmentation:** Apply contextual data augmentation techniques to generate various augmented datasets.
3. **Pretraining:** Train the models using the augmented datasets in a self-supervised manner.
4. **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune the pretrained models on the labeled data for downstream tasks.
5. **Evaluation:** Measure the performance using the specified evaluation metrics and compare with baseline models pretrained without contextual augmentation.

By following this detailed experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the hypothesis that self-supervised pretraining with contextual augmentation improves the robustness and performance of AI models on downstream tasks.
