# Experiment Report: Investigate novel, computationally inexpensive dat

## Idea
Investigate novel, computationally inexpensive data augmentation methods tailored for specific types of data (e.g., image, text) that can be implemented on-the-fly during training. Focus on maximizing the diversity and quality of augmented data to enhance model generalization while keeping resource usage low.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate and evaluate novel, computationally inexpensive data augmentation methods tailored for specific data types, particularly images and text. The goal is to implement these augmentation methods on-the-fly during the training phase, aiming to maximize the diversity and quality of the augmented data. This, in turn, is expected to enhance the model's generalization capabilities while keeping resource usage low.

### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Augmentation Method Design**
  - Design novel data augmentation techniques for images and text.
    - **Images**: Implement lightweight transformations such as random crops, flips, rotations, color jittering, and Gaussian noise.
    - **Text**: Implement augmentations such as synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, and random deletion.
  - Ensure that these augmentations can be applied on-the-fly during training to minimize memory and computational overhead.

- **Step 2: Baseline Model Training**
  - Train baseline models on the original datasets without any augmentation to establish a performance benchmark.

- **Step 3: Augmented Model Training**
  - Train models using the novel augmentation techniques.
  - Compare the performance against the baseline models to assess the impact of the augmentations.

- **Step 4: Evaluation**
  - Evaluate the models on validation and test datasets using standard metrics.
  - Analyze the diversity and quality of the augmented data and its effect on model generalization.

### 3. Datasets
- **Images**: CIFAR-10 (available on Hugging Face: `cifar10`)
- **Text**: SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) (available on Hugging Face: `sst2`)

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Model**: ResNet-18
  - Chosen for its balance between performance and computational efficiency.

- **Text Model**: BERT-base
  - Chosen for its state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks.

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Image Model (ResNet-18)**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 50
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Weight Decay: 0.0001

- **Text Model (BERT-base)**:
  - Learning Rate: 2e-5
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 3
  - Optimizer: AdamW
  - Weight Decay: 0.01
  - Max Sequence Length: 128

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Images (CIFAR-10)**:
  - Accuracy: The primary metric for evaluating classification performance.
  - F1 Score: To evaluate the balance between precision and recall.

- **Text (SST-2)**:
  - Accuracy: The primary metric for evaluating classification performance.
  - F1 Score: To evaluate the balance between precision and recall.
  - Loss: Cross-entropy loss to assess model training performance.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Download and preprocess CIFAR-10 and SST-2 datasets.
   - Split datasets into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Augmentation Implementation**:
   - Implement the designed augmentation methods using libraries such as Albumentations for images and nlpaug for text.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train baseline models on original datasets.
   - Train augmented models with on-the-fly augmentation techniques.
   - Use early stopping based on validation performance to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate trained models on test datasets.
   - Compare the performance metrics of baseline and augmented models.
   - Perform statistical significance tests to assess the impact of augmentations.

5. **Analysis**:
   - Analyze the diversity and quality of augmented data.
   - Visualize examples of augmented data.
   - Discuss the trade-offs between augmentation complexity and computational efficiency.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to derive insights into the effectiveness of novel, computationally inexpensive data augmentation methods in improving model generalization for both image and text data.
