## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment Using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to test whether dynamically adjusting the learning rate (LR) of a neural network using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent can improve the model's performance compared to static or pre-defined learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Define the RL Environment**
  - The RL environment will represent the training process of a neural network. The state will include information such as the current learning rate, loss, gradients, and epoch number.
  - The action space will consist of a set of possible adjustments to the learning rate (e.g., increase, decrease, or maintain the current rate).
  - The reward will be based on the improvement (or lack thereof) in the model's performance, such as the reduction in validation loss or increase in accuracy.

- **Step 2: Train the RL Agent**
  - Use a deep Q-network (DQN) or a policy gradient method (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) to train the RL agent to select the optimal learning rate adjustment at each step.

- **Step 3: Integrate RL Agent with Model Training**
  - During the training of the neural network, at each epoch, the RL agent will decide the adjustment to the learning rate based on the current state.
  - The learning rate will be updated accordingly, and the training will continue with the new learning rate.

- **Step 4: Evaluate Performance**
  - Compare the performance of the model trained with the dynamically adjusted learning rate against models trained with static and pre-defined learning rate schedules.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Training and Evaluation Datasets:**
  - **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.
  - **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 highly polar movie reviews. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.
  - **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits, with 60,000 examples in the training set and 10,000 in the test set. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10 & MNIST)**
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Input layer: 32x32x3 (CIFAR-10) or 28x28x1 (MNIST)
    - Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
    - Max-pooling layers
    - Fully connected layers

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Static Learning Rate (Baseline):**
  - learning_rate: 0.001
- **Pre-defined Learning Rate Schedule (Baseline):**
  - initial_learning_rate: 0.001

  - epsilon (for DQN): 0.1
  - learning_rate (for RL agent): 0.001
  - batch_size: 32
  - replay_buffer_size: 10000

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure the model's accuracy on the test set after training.
- **Validation Loss**: Track the validation loss during training to monitor overfitting.
- **Training Time**: Measure the total time taken to train the model.
- **Learning Rate Path**: Analyze the learning rate adjustments made by the RL agent during training.
- **Convergence Speed**: Compare the number of epochs required to reach a certain performance threshold.

By following this plan, we aim to determine if dynamic learning rate adjustment using reinforcement learning can lead to better model performance and more efficient training processes in AI/ML applications.

## Code Changes

### File: train_model.py
**Original Code:**
```python
model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
num_epochs = 10

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train(model, optimizer, train_loader)

```
**Updated Code:**
```python
model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005)  # Reduced learning rate
num_epochs = 20  # Increased number of epochs

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train(model, optimizer, train_loader)
    eval_results = evaluate(model, eval_loader)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}: {eval_results}')
```
