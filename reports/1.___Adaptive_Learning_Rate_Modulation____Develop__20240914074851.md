# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Modulation**: Develop 

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Modulation**: Develop an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training based on real-time feedback on gradient stability and convergence metrics. The goal is to optimize training speed and stability without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and test an adaptive learning rate modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network based on real-time feedback on gradient stability and convergence metrics. The aim is to enhance training speed and stability, reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. Methodology
#### Algorithm Development
- **Step 1**: Implement a baseline dynamic learning rate algorithm, such as Learning Rate Annealing or Cyclical Learning Rates, for initial comparison.
- **Step 2**: Develop the new Adaptive Learning Rate Modulation (ALRM) algorithm. The ALRM will monitor gradient norms and convergence metrics (e.g., change in loss, rate of decrease in loss) in real-time.
- **Step 3**: Integrate the ALRM algorithm into the training loop of a neural network.

#### Experiment Design
- **Step 1**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Step 2**: Train the model using a static learning rate as a baseline.
- **Step 3**: Train the model using a baseline dynamic learning rate (e.g., Cyclical Learning Rate).
- **Step 4**: Train the model using the ALRM algorithm.
- **Step 5**: Evaluate and compare the performance across different setups.

#### Real-time Feedback Mechanism
- **Gradient Stability**: Calculate the norm of the gradients at each iteration.
- **Convergence Metrics**: Monitor the loss function and its rate of change.
- **Adaptive Adjustment**: Increase the learning rate if the gradients are stable and the loss is decreasing at a slow rate. Decrease it if the gradients are unstable or the loss is oscillating.

### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. [Available on Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images in 10 classes. [Available on Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mnist)
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews. [Available on Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb)

### 4. Model Architecture
- **CIFAR-10**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with architecture similar to VGG-16.
- **MNIST**: Simple feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers of 128 neurons each.
- **IMDB**: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequence modeling with an embedding layer of 128 dimensions followed by an LSTM layer with 128 units.

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.01
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Gradient Norm Threshold**: 1.0
- **Learning Rate Modulation Parameters**:
  - **Increase Factor**: 1.1
  - **Decrease Factor**: 0.9
  - **Stability Check Interval**: Every 10 iterations
  - **Convergence Threshold**: 0.01 change in loss over 10 iterations

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Time**: Time taken to reach a specific loss threshold.
- **Final Accuracy**: Accuracy on the test set after training is complete.
- **Loss Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a stable loss value.
- **Gradient Stability**: Variance of gradient norms over training.
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Measure of how sensitive the model performance is to initial learning rate settings.

### Conclusion
This experiment will determine whether the Adaptive Learning Rate Modulation (ALRM) algorithm can improve training efficiency and stability compared to a static learning rate and traditional dynamic learning rate algorithms. The results from this experiment can potentially lead to a more robust and less hyperparameter-sensitive training process for neural networks.
