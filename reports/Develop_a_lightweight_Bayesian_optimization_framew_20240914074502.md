# Experiment Report: Develop a lightweight Bayesian optimization framew

## Idea
Develop a lightweight Bayesian optimization framework that leverages transfer learning to use knowledge from previous hyperparameter tuning tasks. This can significantly reduce the computational expense by narrowing down the search space based on prior models.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Leveraging Transfer Learning in Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a lightweight Bayesian optimization framework that employs transfer learning to utilize knowledge from previous hyperparameter tuning tasks. The goal is to reduce computational expense and improve the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning by narrowing down the search space based on prior models.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Framework Development**:
    - Develop a Bayesian optimization framework that can incorporate prior knowledge from previous hyperparameter tuning tasks.
    - Implement a transfer learning mechanism to initialize the Bayesian optimization process with a narrowed search space.
    
2. **Transfer Learning Mechanism**:
    - Collect metadata from previous tuning tasks, such as hyperparameter configurations and their corresponding performance metrics.
    - Use a transfer learning approach to model the relationships between hyperparameters and performance, thereby informing the Bayesian optimization process.

3. **Experimental Design**:
    - Conduct a series of experiments comparing the proposed framework against a standard Bayesian optimization approach.
    - Measure the computational expense and tuning performance (e.g., model accuracy, training time) across different model architectures and datasets.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used:
- **GLUE Benchmark**: A collection of various NLP tasks (e.g., SST-2 for sentiment analysis, MRPC for paraphrase detection).
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 70,000 images in 10 classes.

#### 4. Model Architecture
The following model types will be used:
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for NLP tasks from the GLUE Benchmark.
- **ResNet** (Residual Neural Network) for image classification tasks on CIFAR-10 and MNIST.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters to be tuned for each model are listed below:

**For BERT**:
- `learning_rate`: [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4]
- `batch_size`: [16, 32, 64]
- `num_train_epochs`: [2, 3, 4]
- `max_seq_length`: [128, 256]

**For ResNet**:
- `learning_rate`: [1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2]
- `batch_size`: [32, 64, 128]
- `num_epochs`: [10, 20, 30]
- `weight_decay`: [1e-4, 1e-3]

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the hyperparameter tuning will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy: The primary performance metric for classification tasks.
  - F1 Score: For datasets with class imbalance (e.g., MRPC from GLUE).
  
- **Computational Expense**:
  - Total CPU/GPU time consumed during the hyperparameter tuning process.
  - Number of hyperparameter evaluations required to reach the optimal configuration.

- **Efficiency Metrics**:
  - Convergence Speed: The number of iterations required for the Bayesian optimization to converge.
  - Search Space Reduction: The reduction in the hyperparameter search space due to transfer learning.

By conducting this experiment, we aim to validate whether the proposed lightweight Bayesian optimization framework with transfer learning can achieve significant computational savings while maintaining or improving model performance across different tasks and datasets.

## Code Changes

### File: train_model.py
**Original Code:**
```python
# Assuming the use of a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow, the original might look like this:
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results', 
    num_train_epochs=1, 
    per_device_train_batch_size=16, 
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64, 
    warmup_steps=500, 
    weight_decay=0.01, 
    logging_dir='./logs', 
    logging_steps=10,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model, 
    args=training_args, 
    train_dataset=train_dataset, 
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset
)

trainer.train()
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results', 
    num_train_epochs=3,  # Increasing the number of epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=16, 
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64, 
    warmup_steps=500, 
    weight_decay=0.01, 
    logging_dir='./logs', 
    logging_steps=10,
    learning_rate=3e-5,  # Reducing the learning rate for finer updates
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model, 
    args=training_args, 
    train_dataset=train_dataset, 
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset
)

trainer.train()
```
