# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Tuning via Meta-Learning:

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Tuning via Meta-Learning:** Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training to optimize convergence speed and model performance. This approach should focus on leveraging few-shot learning techniques to adapt quickly to different datasets and model architectures.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Tuning via Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training. The goal is to optimize both convergence speed and overall model performance. The meta-learning algorithm should be capable of leveraging few-shot learning techniques to quickly adapt to different datasets and model architectures.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will be conducted in two stages:
1. **Meta-Learning Phase:** Develop a meta-learning algorithm that learns to adjust the learning rate dynamically. This phase involves training a meta-learner on a diverse set of tasks.
2. **Evaluation Phase:** Test the performance of the meta-learning algorithm on unseen datasets and model architectures to evaluate its ability to generalize.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Preparation:** Collect and preprocess datasets from Hugging Face Datasets.
2. **Meta-Learner Training:** Train the meta-learner using a variety of tasks (datasets and model architectures).
3. **Implementation:** Integrate the meta-learner into the training loop of standard neural networks.
4. **Evaluation:** Compare the performance of models trained with adaptive learning rates against fixed-rate baselines.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used:
- **Image Classification:**
  - CIFAR-10 (`cifar10`)
  - MNIST (`mnist`)
  - Fashion-MNIST (`fashion_mnist`)
- **Text Classification:**
  - IMDB Reviews (`imdb`)
  - AG News (`ag_news`)
  - Yelp Reviews (`yelp_review_full`)
- **Few-Shot Learning Tasks:**
  - FewRel (`few_rel`)
  - Few-NERD (`few_nerd`)

#### 4. Model Architecture
The following model types will be used:
- **Image Classification:**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (e.g., ResNet-18)
  - Vision Transformers (ViTs)
- **Text Classification:**
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (e.g., LSTM, GRU)
  - Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The key hyperparameters for the experiment are listed below:
- **Base Learning Rate:** `0.001`
- **Batch Size:** `32`
- **Epochs:** `50`
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Meta-Learner Model:** LSTM
- **Meta-Learner Learning Rate:** `0.0001`
- **Adaptation Steps:** `5`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics will be used to evaluate the performance of the models:
- **Convergence Speed:** Number of epochs to reach a certain accuracy threshold (e.g., 90%).
- **Final Model Performance:** 
  - **Image Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - **Text Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Learning Rate Dynamics:** Visualization of learning rate changes over time.
- **Generalization Performance:** Performance on unseen datasets and architectures.
- **Training Time:** Total time taken for training.

By carefully following this experiment plan, we aim to validate the efficacy of adaptive learning rate tuning via meta-learning in improving both the convergence speed and overall performance of neural networks across diverse tasks and architectures.
