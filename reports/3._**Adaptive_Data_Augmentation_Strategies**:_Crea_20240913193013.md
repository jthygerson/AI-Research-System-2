# Experiment Report: 3. **Adaptive Data Augmentation Strategies**: Crea

## Idea
3. **Adaptive Data Augmentation Strategies**: Create a dynamic data augmentation framework that adapts augmentation techniques based on the current state of model training. The framework would analyze the model's performance on various augmented data samples and iteratively adjust the augmentation parameters to maximize learning efficiency and model robustness.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Data Augmentation Strategies

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive data augmentation framework in improving the performance, learning efficiency, and robustness of AI models. The framework will dynamically adjust augmentation parameters based on the model's performance on augmented data samples during training.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Choose a baseline model and train it using standard data augmentation techniques.
   - Record its performance metrics to serve as a comparison benchmark.

2. **Adaptive Augmentation Framework:**
   - Develop a dynamic data augmentation framework that:
     - Monitors the modelâ€™s performance on validation data.
     - Adjusts augmentation parameters (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) in response to observed trends.
   - Implement an algorithm that iteratively tweaks these parameters to maximize model performance.

3. **Training Protocol:**
   - Divide the training process into epochs.
   - At the end of each epoch, evaluate model performance on a validation set.
   - Use the validation performance to update augmentation parameters.
   - Retrain the model with the updated augmentation settings for the next epoch.

4. **Comparison:**
   - Compare the performance of the adaptively augmented model against the baseline model.
   - Use statistical tests to assess the significance of any observed improvements.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use two datasets from Hugging Face Datasets:
- **CIFAR-10:** A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks.
  - [CIFAR-10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)
- **IMDB:** A dataset for binary sentiment classification.
  - [IMDB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb)

These datasets will help in assessing the framework's effectiveness across different types of data (images and text).

#### 4. Model Architecture
For this experiment, we will use the following model types:
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10):**
  - **ResNet-18:** A commonly used convolutional neural network architecture.
    - [ResNet-18](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=resnet)
- **Text Classification (IMDB):**
  - **BERT Base:** A transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of text.
    - [BERT Base](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Here are the key hyperparameters for both models:

**ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10):**
- Learning Rate: `0.001`
- Batch Size: `64`
- Epochs: `50`
- Optimizer: `Adam`
- Initial Augmentation Parameters:
  - Rotation: `0.2`
  - Scaling: `0.1`
  - Flipping: `0.5`

**BERT Base (IMDB):**
- Learning Rate: `2e-5`
- Batch Size: `32`
- Epochs: `3`
- Optimizer: `AdamW`
- Initial Augmentation Parameters (for text):
  - Synonym Replacement Probability: `0.1`
  - Random Insertion Probability: `0.1`
  - Random Swap Probability: `0.1`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
**For CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18):**
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified images.
- **Top-1 Accuracy:** The model's ability to correctly identify the top prediction.
- **Loss:** The cross-entropy loss during training and validation.
- **Robustness:** Measured by the model's performance on a corrupted version of the CIFAR-10 dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10-C).

**For IMDB (BERT Base):**
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified sentiments.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Loss:** The binary cross-entropy loss during training and validation.
- **Robustness:** Evaluated using an out-of-domain dataset or adversarial examples.

Each of these metrics will be recorded and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the adaptive data augmentation framework in comparison to the baseline models.
