# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization via Real-

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization via Real-time Feedback Mechanisms**: Develop an AI-driven adaptive learning rate optimizer that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the training process. This optimizer would use a small neural network to predict optimal learning rates by analyzing gradients and loss trends, aiming to improve convergence speed and stability.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization via Real-time Feedback Mechanisms

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an AI-driven adaptive learning rate optimizer that dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on real-time feedback from the training process. We aim to determine whether this adaptive optimizer can improve convergence speed and stability compared to traditional learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Baseline Setup**:
    - Train a set of baseline models using traditional learning rate schedules (constant, step decay, cosine annealing).
    - Record performance metrics for comparison.

2. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizer**:
    - Develop a small neural network that functions as an adaptive learning rate predictor.
    - The predictor network will take as input real-time training feedback (e.g., gradients, loss trends) and output the optimal learning rate.
    - Integrate this predictor with the training loop of the target models.

3. **Training Procedure**:
    - Initialize the target model and the adaptive learning rate predictor.
    - During training, collect real-time feedback (gradients, loss).
    - Use the feedback to train the predictor network.
    - Adjust the learning rate of the target model based on the output of the predictor network.
    - Continue training until convergence or a predefined number of epochs.

4. **Comparison**:
    - Compare the performance of models trained with the adaptive learning rate optimizer against the baseline models.
    - Evaluate based on convergence speed, stability, and final performance metrics.

#### 3. Datasets
- **MNIST** (https://huggingface.co/datasets/mnist): Handwritten digit recognition dataset.
- **CIFAR-10** (https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10): Object recognition dataset with 10 classes.
- **IMDB** (https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb): Sentiment analysis dataset for movie reviews.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **For MNIST**:
    - Baseline: Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
    - Adaptive: Same CNN architecture with adaptive learning rate optimizer.
- **For CIFAR-10**:
    - Baseline: ResNet-18.
    - Adaptive: ResNet-18 with adaptive learning rate optimizer.
- **For IMDB**:
    - Baseline: Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism.
    - Adaptive: Bidirectional LSTM with adaptive learning rate optimizer.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Baseline Learning Rate Schedules**:
    - Constant: `learning_rate = 0.01`
    - Step Decay: `initial_learning_rate = 0.01`, `decay_rate = 0.5`, `decay_steps = 10`
    - Cosine Annealing: `initial_learning_rate = 0.01`, `T_max = 50`, `eta_min = 0.001`
- **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizer**:
    - Predictor Network: 
        - Layers: `input_size = number of feedback features`, `hidden_layers = [64, 32]`, `output_size = 1`
        - Activation: `ReLU` for hidden layers, `Sigmoid` for output layer (scaled to learning rate range)
    - Training Parameters:
        - `learning_rate = 0.001` (for predictor network)
        - `batch_size = 32`
        - `epochs = 50`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Convergence Speed**:
    - Number of epochs to reach a predefined performance threshold (e.g., 95% accuracy for MNIST).
- **Stability**:
    - Variance in loss over the last 10 epochs of training.
- **Final Performance**:
    - Accuracy (for MNIST and CIFAR-10).
    - F1-score (for IMDB).
- **Training Time**:
    - Total time taken to train the model until convergence.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to rigorously test the hypothesis that an AI-driven adaptive learning rate optimizer can lead to faster and more stable convergence in various machine learning tasks.
