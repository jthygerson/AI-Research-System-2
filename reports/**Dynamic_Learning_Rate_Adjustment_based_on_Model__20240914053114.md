# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment based on Model 

## Idea
**Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment based on Model Uncertainty**: Develop an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on the model's uncertainty estimates. By using techniques like Monte Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles to measure uncertainty, the learning rate can be increased when the model is confident and decreased when the model is uncertain, potentially speeding up convergence and improving final accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment based on Model Uncertainty

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to assess the efficacy of dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on model uncertainty in improving the performance of machine learning models. By leveraging uncertainty estimation techniques like Monte Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles, we aim to determine whether adjusting the learning rate according to the model's confidence can speed up convergence and improve final accuracy.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Baseline Setup**: Train a model using a fixed learning rate schedule (e.g., a standard learning rate decay).
2. **Uncertainty Estimation**: Implement Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles to estimate model uncertainty during training.
3. **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment**: Develop an algorithm that adjusts the learning rate dynamically. When the model is confident (low uncertainty), increase the learning rate; when the model is uncertain (high uncertainty), decrease the learning rate.
4. **Training and Testing**: Train the models on a selected dataset and evaluate performance.
5. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of the dynamically adjusted learning rate model against the baseline fixed learning rate model.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification, containing 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews.
- **Hugging Face Dataset Source**: The datasets can be accessed via the Hugging Face Datasets library.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as ResNet-18.
- **Text Classification**: Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanism.

  - `mc_samples`: 50

- **Deep Ensembles Specific**:
  - `num_ensembles`: 5

- **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment**:
  - `confidence_threshold`: 0.1
  - `learning_rate_increase_factor`: 1.2
  - `learning_rate_decrease_factor`: 0.8

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances in the test set.
- **Loss**: The cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.
- **Convergence Time**: The number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold.
- **Calibration Metrics**: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to measure how well the predicted probabilities reflect the true probabilities.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Measure the correlation between uncertainty estimates and model errors.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets using the Hugging Face Datasets library.
   - Preprocess the data (normalize images, tokenize text).

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train the baseline models with a fixed learning rate schedule.
   - Implement Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles for uncertainty estimation.
   - Train the models with dynamic learning rate adjustment based on uncertainty estimates.

3. **Dynamic Learning Rate Algorithm**:
   - Calculate uncertainty for each batch during training.
   - Adjust the learning rate dynamically according to the confidence threshold and learning rate factors.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate and compare the models on the test set using the defined metrics.
   - Analyze the impact of dynamic learning rate adjustment on convergence speed and final accuracy.

5. **Results and Analysis**:
   - Plot training and validation accuracy/loss curves for both baseline and dynamically adjusted models.
   - Compare convergence times and final accuracies.
   - Discuss the effect of uncertainty-based learning rate adjustment on model performance and calibration.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to systematically investigate the potential benefits of dynamic learning rate adjustment based on model uncertainty in enhancing AI/ML model performance.
