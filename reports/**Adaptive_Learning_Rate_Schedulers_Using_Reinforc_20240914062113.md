# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Using Reinforc

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Using Reinforcement Learning**: Develop a reinforcement learning-based adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on the model's performance. This approach aims to optimize convergence speed and final model accuracy without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during the training of AI models. The proposed approach aims to optimize both the convergence speed and the final model accuracy, reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning traditionally required for fixed or manually adjusted learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Reinforcement Learning Agent Design**:
    - **State Representation**: The state can include current learning rate, gradient norms, training loss, validation loss, and other training dynamics.
    - **Action Space**: Actions can be discrete or continuous adjustments to the learning rate (e.g., increase by 10%, decrease by 10%).
    - **Reward Function**: A reward function that encourages faster convergence and higher accuracy. For example, it can be based on the reduction in validation loss or improvement in accuracy within a given epoch.

2. **Training Process**:
    - Initialize the RL agent.
    - For each epoch, the RL agent decides on the learning rate adjustment based on the current state.
    - Apply the chosen learning rate for the next epoch.
    - Update the state and reward the RL agent based on the performance metrics.

3. **Baseline Comparisons**:
    - Compare the RL-based adaptive scheduler with traditional fixed learning rates and common schedulers such as StepLR, ExponentialLR, and CosineAnnealingLR.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets will be used for training and evaluation, sourced from Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **Image Classification**: 
    - CIFAR-10: `datasets.load_dataset("cifar10")`
    - MNIST: `datasets.load_dataset("mnist")`
2. **Natural Language Processing**:
    - IMDB Reviews (Sentiment Analysis): `datasets.load_dataset("imdb")`
    - SST-2 (Sentiment Analysis): `datasets.load_dataset("glue", "sst2")`

#### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Image Classification**:
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-18 and VGG-16.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as LSTM.
    - Transformer-based models like BERT (using pre-trained BERT base).

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: `0.001`
- **Batch Size**: `64`
- **Epochs**: `50`
- **Optimizer**: Adam (`betas=(0.9, 0.999)`, `eps=1e-08`, `weight_decay=0`)
- **RL Agent**:
    - **Learning Rate**: `0.0001`
    - **Discount Factor (γ)**: `0.99`
    - **Exploration Rate (ε)**: `0.1` (with decay)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Time**: The total time taken to complete the training process.
- **Convergence Rate**: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy or loss threshold.
- **Final Model Accuracy**: Accuracy on the validation/test set after training.
- **Validation Loss**: The loss on the validation set after training.
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The robustness of the RL-based scheduler to different initial learning rates compared to traditional schedulers.

By following this experimental plan, the goal is to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of a reinforcement learning-based adaptive learning rate scheduler in improving model training efficiency and performance across different types of tasks and datasets.
