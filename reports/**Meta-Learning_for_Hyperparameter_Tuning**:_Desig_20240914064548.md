# Experiment Report: **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Desig

## Idea
**Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Design a meta-learning framework that can learn optimal hyperparameter settings for different types of small-scale neural networks. This involves training a meta-model on a diverse set of tasks to predict good hyperparameter configurations, thereby reducing the need for exhaustive grid search or random search.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning

### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate a meta-learning framework that can predict optimal hyperparameter configurations for different types of small-scale neural networks. This approach aims to reduce the need for exhaustive hyperparameter tuning methods like grid search or random search, thereby saving computational resources and time.

### 2. Methodology

#### Meta-Learning Framework:
1. **Meta-Dataset Generation**:
   - Create a diverse set of tasks by training various small-scale neural networks on different datasets.
   - For each task, record the performance of the model under different hyperparameter configurations.

2. **Meta-Model Training**:
   - Train a meta-model to predict the performance of a given neural network configuration on a specific task.
   - The input to the meta-model will be a combination of task-specific features (e.g., dataset characteristics) and model-specific features (e.g., architecture details and hyperparameters).

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of the meta-learning approach with traditional hyperparameter tuning methods (grid search, random search).
   - Use a set of unseen tasks to evaluate the generalization of the meta-model.

### 3. Datasets
We will use a variety of datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets to ensure diversity in tasks:
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digits dataset.
- **Fashion-MNIST**: Clothing articles dataset.
- **CIFAR-10**: 10 classes of tiny images dataset.
- **SVHN**: Street View House Numbers dataset.
- **IMDB**: Movie reviews sentiment classification.

### 4. Model Architecture
We will focus on small-scale neural network architectures to create the meta-dataset:
- **MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron)**: A simple feedforward neural network.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A basic convolutional network with 2-3 convolution layers followed by fully connected layers.
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: A simple recurrent network for sequential data tasks.

### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters to be tuned and used as input features for the meta-model include:
- **Learning Rate**: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
- **Batch Size**: [16, 32, 64]
- **Number of Layers**: [2, 3, 4]
- **Number of Units per Layer**: [32, 64, 128]
- **Dropout Rate**: [0.0, 0.2, 0.5]
- **Activation Function**: ['relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid']
- **Optimizer**: ['adam', 'sgd', 'rmsprop']

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
We will evaluate the performance of the meta-learning framework using the following metrics:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: How accurately the meta-model predicts the performance of a given configuration.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: To measure the error in performance prediction.
- **Time Efficiency**: Time saved compared to exhaustive search methods.
- **Final Model Performance**: The performance (e.g., accuracy, loss) of the neural networks using the hyperparameters suggested by the meta-model compared to those obtained through traditional methods.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of meta-learning for hyperparameter tuning and its potential to streamline the AI model development process.
