# Experiment Report: **Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Edge Device

## Idea
**Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Edge Devices**: Design a streamlined knowledge distillation process that allows a smaller, less complex student model to learn from a larger teacher model with minimal computational resources. The research would focus on optimizing the distillation process to ensure high performance of the student model while reducing training time.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Edge Devices

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate a streamlined knowledge distillation process that enables a smaller, less complex student model to learn from a larger, more complex teacher model with minimal computational resources. The goal is to optimize the distillation process to ensure that the student model achieves high performance while significantly reducing training time and computational cost, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will proceed through the following stages:
1. **Teacher Model Training**: Train a large, complex model (teacher) on the selected dataset to achieve high performance.
2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Implement the knowledge distillation process where the student model learns from the teacher model. This will involve:
    - Training the student model using the logits (unscaled probabilities) produced by the teacher model.
    - Using temperature scaling to soften the logits and improve the distillation process.
    - Applying loss functions that combine the traditional classification loss and the distillation loss.
3. **Optimization Techniques**: Explore and apply various optimization techniques to streamline the distillation process, such as:
    - Progressive Distillation: Gradually increasing the complexity of the student model during training.
    - Data Augmentation: Using data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of the student model.
    - Quantization-aware Training: Training the student model with quantization-aware techniques to further reduce computational requirements.

#### 3. Datasets
The datasets chosen for this experiment are well-established benchmarks available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **ImageNet**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research.
- **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: A reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text from the corresponding reading passage.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Teacher Model**: ResNet-50 for image classification tasks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and BERT for NLP tasks (SQuAD).
- **Student Model**: MobileNetV2 for image classification tasks and DistilBERT for NLP tasks. These models are chosen for their smaller size and efficiency, making them suitable for edge devices.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Temperature (T)**: 3
- **Learning Rate (Teacher Model)**: 0.001
- **Learning Rate (Student Model)**: 0.01
- **Batch Size**: 128
- **Number of Epochs**: 50
- **Distillation Loss Weight (α)**: 0.5
- **Classification Loss Weight (1-α)**: 0.5
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Weight Decay**: 1e-4
- **Data Augmentation Techniques**: Random cropping, horizontal flipping for images
- **Quantization-aware Training**: Enabled for the student model

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
- **Inference Time**: The time taken for the model to make predictions on a given input.
- **Model Size**: The memory footprint of the model, measured in megabytes.
- **Energy Consumption**: The computational energy consumed during training and inference, measured in joules or watt-hours.

This experiment plan is designed to comprehensively evaluate the efficiency and performance of the knowledge distillation process, ensuring that the student model is well-suited for deployment on edge devices with minimal computational resources.
