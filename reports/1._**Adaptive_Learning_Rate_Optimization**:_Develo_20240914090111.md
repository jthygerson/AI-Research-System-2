# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develo

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop a lightweight algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training based on real-time feedback from loss function changes, to optimize training speed and model accuracy. This could be tested and validated using standard datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and validate a lightweight algorithm for dynamically adjusting the learning rate during the training process based on real-time feedback from changes in the loss function. We aim to determine whether this approach can improve training speed and model accuracy compared to static learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Algorithm Development**: Implement a dynamic learning rate adjustment algorithm that modifies the learning rate based on the rate of change of the loss function. The algorithm will:
  - Increase the learning rate when the loss improvement rate is high.
  - Decrease the learning rate when the loss improvement rate is low.
  - Maintain the learning rate when the loss change is minimal.
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of the dynamic learning rate algorithm against traditional static learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay).
- **Training Procedure**: Train models on standard datasets (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) using both the adaptive learning rate and static schedules.
- **Validation**: Evaluate model performance in terms of training speed and accuracy on a validation set.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. (Available on Hugging Face Datasets)
- **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits in 10 classes. (Available on Hugging Face Datasets)

- **Common Hyperparameters**:
  - Batch size: `64`
  - Epochs: `50`
  - Optimizer: `Adam`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Speed**: Measured as the total training time in seconds.
- **Model Accuracy**: Measured as the classification accuracy on the validation set.
- **Loss**: Measured as the final loss value on the validation set.
- **Convergence Rate**: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold.
