# Experiment Report: Develop a lightweight Bayesian optimization framew

## Idea
Develop a lightweight Bayesian optimization framework that utilizes meta-learning to quickly adapt hyperparameters based on past experiences across similar tasks. This can significantly reduce the computational effort required for hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a lightweight Bayesian optimization framework that utilizes meta-learning to quickly adapt hyperparameters based on past experiences across similar tasks. The hypothesis is that this approach will significantly reduce the computational effort required for hyperparameter tuning while maintaining or improving model performance.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Framework Development**: 
   - Implement a Bayesian optimization framework that incorporates meta-learning. This framework will learn from previous hyperparameter tuning tasks to make faster and more accurate predictions about optimal hyperparameters for new tasks.
   
2. **Baseline Comparison**: 
   - Compare the performance of the meta-learning Bayesian optimization framework against standard Bayesian optimization and grid search.
   
3. **Task Definition**:
   - Define a set of machine learning tasks that are similar but not identical. For instance, different classification tasks using different subsets of a dataset or variations in the data distribution.
   
4. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - For each task, run hyperparameter tuning using both the meta-learning Bayesian optimization framework and the baseline methods.
   - Measure the time taken for hyperparameter tuning and the performance of the resulting models.

### 3. Datasets
- **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
- **CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research)**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset of 50,000 highly polar movie reviews.
- **AG News**: A dataset of news articles categorized into 4 classes.

All these datasets are available on Hugging Face Datasets.

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10).
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for text classification tasks (IMDB Reviews, AG News).

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
- **Batch Size**: [16, 32, 64]
- **Number of Layers (CNN)**: [2, 3, 4]
- **Number of Units (LSTM)**: [50, 100, 150]
- **Dropout Rate**: [0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
- **Optimizer**: ['Adam', 'SGD']

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Model Performance**: 
  - For classification tasks: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
  - For optimization efficiency: Time taken to find the optimal hyperparameters.
- **Computational Efficiency**: 
  - Number of iterations required to converge to the optimal hyperparameters.
  - Total computational cost (measured in FLOPs or GPU hours).

#### Step 4: Experiment Execution
- For each dataset, run hyperparameter tuning using the meta-learning Bayesian optimization framework, standard Bayesian optimization, and grid search.
- Record the time taken and the performance metrics for the models trained with the optimal hyperparameters.

#### Step 5: Analysis and Reporting
- Compare the performance and computational efficiency of the meta-learning Bayesian optimization framework against the baselines.
- Analyze the results to determine if the meta-learning approach significantly reduces the computational effort while maintaining or improving model performance.

#### Step 6: Replication and Validation
- Replicate the experiment with different hyperparameter spaces or model architectures to validate the robustness of the results.
- Conduct statistical tests to ensure the significance of the findings.
