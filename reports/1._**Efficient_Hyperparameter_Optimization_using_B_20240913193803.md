This method could significantly reduce the computational resources and time required for tuning deep learning models.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization using Bayesian Search with Pruning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a lightweight hyperparameter optimization algorithm that combines Bayesian optimization with early stopping techniques. The goal is to quickly identify promising hyperparameter settings for deep learning models while significantly reducing computational resources and time required for tuning.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Implement Bayesian optimization using Gaussian Processes.
   - Integrate an early stopping mechanism based on intermediate performance metrics to prune unpromising hyperparameter settings early in the training process.
   
2. **Experiment Setup**:
   - Select a diverse set of deep learning models and datasets to ensure the generalizability of the results.
   - Divide the experiment into two main phases: baseline comparison and efficiency evaluation.
   
3. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Use grid search and random search as baseline hyperparameter optimization methods.
   - Compare the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed method against these baselines.
   
4. **Efficiency Evaluation**:
   - Measure the time taken and computational resources used by each method.
   - Evaluate the quality of the hyperparameters identified by each method in terms of model performance.

#### 3. Datasets
Select datasets from Hugging Face Datasets that cover a range of tasks including image classification, natural language processing, and structured data:
   - **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (Dataset: `cifar10`)
   - **Natural Language Processing**: IMDB Reviews for sentiment analysis (Dataset: `imdb`)
   - **Structured Data**: UCI Adult Income Dataset (Dataset: `adult`)

#### 4. Model Architecture
Select a representative model for each dataset type:
   - **Image Classification**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
     - Example: ResNet-18
   - **Natural Language Processing**: Transformer-based model
     - Example: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
   - **Structured Data**: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
     - Example: 3-layer fully connected neural network

#### 5. Hyperparameters
List key hyperparameters to be optimized for each model type:
   - **CNN (ResNet-18)**:
     - Learning Rate: `[0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1]`
     - Batch Size: `[32, 64, 128]`
     - Number of Epochs: `[10, 50, 100]`
     - Dropout Rate: `[0.0, 0.3, 0.5]`
     
   - **Transformer (BERT)**:
     - Learning Rate: `[1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5]`
     - Batch Size: `[16, 32]`
     - Number of Epochs: `[3, 4, 5]`
     - Warmup Steps: `[0, 500, 1000]`
     
   - **FNN**:
     - Learning Rate: `[0.001, 0.01, 0.1]`
     - Batch Size: `[32, 64, 128]`
     - Number of Epochs: `[20, 50, 100]`
     - Hidden Layer Sizes: `[(64,), (128,), (128, 64)]`
     - Dropout Rate: `[0.0, 0.3, 0.5]`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate the proposed method using the following metrics:
   - **Model Performance**:
     - Accuracy (for classification tasks)
     - F1 Score (for NLP sentiment analysis)
     - Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) (for structured data)
     
   - **Efficiency**:
     - Time to convergence (total optimization time)
     - Number of evaluations (total training runs)
     - Computational cost (GPU/CPU hours)

By systematically conducting this experiment across multiple models and datasets, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization with pruning in improving hyperparameter tuning efficiency, without compromising model performance.
