### Experiment Plan: Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning via Surrogate Models

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to test the hypothesis that surrogate models can significantly improve the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning in AI/ML systems. Specifically, we aim to:
- Reduce the computational cost of hyperparameter tuning.
- Maintain or improve model performance.
- Compare the surrogate model-based tuning approach with traditional methods, such as grid search and random search.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will be conducted in the following steps:

1. **Baseline Model Training:**
   - Train a baseline model using traditional hyperparameter tuning methods (grid search and random search) to establish a performance benchmark.

2. **Surrogate Model Development:**
   - Develop a surrogate model using a subset of the hyperparameter space and the corresponding performance metrics of the baseline model.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning with Surrogate Model:**
   - Use the surrogate model to predict the performance of different hyperparameter configurations.
   - Select the most promising configurations to evaluate on the actual model.

4. **Performance Comparison:**
   - Compare the model performance and computational cost of the surrogate model-based tuning against the traditional methods.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use two datasets from Hugging Face Datasets for this experiment:

1. **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation):**
   - Tasks: SST-2 (Sentiment Analysis), MRPC (Paraphrase Detection)
   - Source: [GLUE on Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue)

2. **CIFAR-10:**
   - Task: Image Classification
   - Source: [CIFAR-10 on Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cifar10)

#### 4. Model Architecture
We will use different model architectures for the two types of tasks:

1. **Text Classification (GLUE SST-2, MRPC):**
   - Model: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
   - Pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face Model Hub: `bert-base-uncased`

2. **Image Classification (CIFAR-10):**
   - Model: ResNet (Residual Networks)
   - Pre-trained ResNet model from Hugging Face Model Hub: `resnet50`

#### 5. Hyperparameters
We will tune the following hyperparameters for each model:

1. **BERT (Text Classification):**
   - learning_rate: [2e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5]
   - batch_size: [16, 32]
   - max_seq_length: [128, 256]
   - num_epochs: [3, 4]

2. **ResNet (Image Classification):**
   - learning_rate: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
   - batch_size: [32, 64]
   - num_epochs: [10, 20]
   - weight_decay: [0.0001, 0.001]

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
We will evaluate the performance of the models using the following metrics:

1. **Text Classification (GLUE SST-2, MRPC):**
   - Accuracy
   - F1 Score
   - Computational Cost (Time and Resources)

2. **Image Classification (CIFAR-10):**
   - Accuracy
   - Top-5 Accuracy
   - Computational Cost (Time and Resources)

#### Experiment Execution
1. **Baseline Model Training:**
   - Perform grid search and random search for both BERT and ResNet models on the respective datasets.
   - Record the best hyperparameter configurations and their performance metrics.

2. **Surrogate Model Development:**
   - Train a surrogate model (e.g., Gaussian Process, Random Forest) using a subset of the hyperparameter configurations and their performance metrics from the baseline model training.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning with Surrogate Model:**
   - Use the surrogate model to predict the performance of new hyperparameter configurations.
   - Evaluate the top predicted configurations on the actual models.

4. **Performance Comparison:**
   - Compare the model performance and computational cost between the surrogate model-based tuning and traditional tuning methods.
   - Analyze the results to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the surrogate model approach.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to validate the hypothesis that surrogate models can enhance the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning in AI/ML systems.
