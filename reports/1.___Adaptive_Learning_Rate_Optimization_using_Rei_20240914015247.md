# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization using Rei

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization using Reinforcement Learning**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training. This agent will learn to optimize the learning rate schedule based on the model's performance metrics in real-time, potentially leading to faster convergence and improved final accuracy.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to test the hypothesis that a reinforcement learning (RL) agent can dynamically adjust the learning rate of a neural network during its training process. The aim is to achieve faster convergence and improved final accuracy by optimizing the learning rate schedule based on real-time performance metrics.

#### 2. Methodology

**Reinforcement Learning Agent Configuration:**
- **Action Space:** The RL agent will adjust the learning rate at each training epoch. Actions will be discrete steps to increase, decrease, or keep the learning rate constant.
- **State Space:** The state will include performance metrics such as current loss, accuracy, learning rate, and epoch number.
- **Reward Function:** The reward will be inversely proportional to the loss, with possible bonus rewards for accuracy improvements and penalties for instability (e.g., sudden loss spikes).

**Training Process:**
1. Initialize the neural network with a default learning rate.
2. Train the RL agent in parallel with the neural network.
3. At each epoch, the RL agent observes the state and decides on the action for the learning rate.
4. Update the learning rate of the neural network based on the action.
5. Record performance metrics (loss, accuracy) and calculate rewards for the RL agent.
6. Continue training until convergence or until a fixed number of epochs are reached.

**RL Algorithm:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Q-Network (DQN), given their success in continuous state and action spaces.

#### 3. Datasets

The experiment will be conducted on several datasets to ensure generalizability:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
3. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training and 10,000 test images.
4. **AG News**: A dataset for text classification with 120,000 training and 7,600 test samples.

Datasets can be sourced from Hugging Face Datasets library for easy access and preprocessing.

#### 4. Model Architecture

**For CIFAR-10 and MNIST:**
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with:
  - Convolutional layers
  - Max-Pooling layers
  - Fully connected layers
  - Softmax output layer

**For IMDB and AG News:**
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer-based model with:
  - Embedding layer
  - LSTM/GRU or Transformer layers
  - Fully connected layers
  - Sigmoid output layer (for binary classification) or Softmax (for multi-class classification)

#### 5. Hyperparameters

**Neural Network Hyperparameters:**
- Initial Learning Rate: 0.001
- Batch Size: 64
- Epochs: 50

**Reinforcement Learning Hyperparameters:**
- Learning Rate: 0.0003
- Gamma (discount factor): 0.99
- Exploration Rate (for DQN): Start at 1.0, decay to 0.01

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Training Loss:** Monitored to observe convergence behavior.
- **Validation Accuracy:** Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **Training Time:** Total time taken to reach convergence.
- **Learning Rate Variation:** Trends and patterns in the learning rate adjustments.

**Comparison Baseline:**
The results will be compared against models trained with static learning rates and popular adaptive learning rate methods such as Adam and SGD with learning rate decay.

By systematically following this experiment plan, we aim to validate whether the RL-based adaptive learning rate optimization can enhance the performance and training efficiency of neural networks across various datasets and model architectures.
