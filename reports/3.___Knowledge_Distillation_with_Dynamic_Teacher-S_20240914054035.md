# Experiment Report: 3. **Knowledge Distillation with Dynamic Teacher-S

## Idea
3. **Knowledge Distillation with Dynamic Teacher-Student Networks**: Design a dynamic knowledge distillation framework where the teacher model is adaptively selected based on the complexity of the student model and the task. This approach should optimize the distillation process to enhance the student model's performance while keeping the computational overhead low, suitable for execution on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Knowledge Distillation with Dynamic Teacher-Student Networks

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to design and evaluate a dynamic knowledge distillation framework where the teacher model is adaptively selected based on the complexity of the student model and the task. The goal is to optimize the distillation process to enhance the student model's performance while maintaining low computational overhead, suitable for execution on a single GPU.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Teacher and Student Model Selection**:
   - **Teacher Model Pool**: Create a pool of pre-trained teacher models of varying complexities.
   - **Student Model**: Initialize a student model with a defined complexity.
   - **Dynamic Selection**: Develop a mechanism to dynamically select a teacher model from the pool based on the current state of the student model and task complexity.

2. **Distillation Process**:
   - **Knowledge Transfer**: Employ knowledge distillation techniques where the teacher model transfers knowledge to the student model. Use logits, feature maps, or attention maps for distillation.
   - **Adaptive Mechanism**: Implement an adaptive mechanism, such as reinforcement learning or a heuristic-based approach, to select the optimal teacher model during training.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the student model with the dynamically selected teacher models.
   - Monitor the student model's performance and computational overhead.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the student model on the task-specific metrics.
   - Compare the performance of the dynamically distilled student model with static distillation and without distillation.
