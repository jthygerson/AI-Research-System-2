# Experiment Report: Develop lightweight, adaptive learning rate schedu

## Idea
Develop lightweight, adaptive learning rate schedulers that dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the real-time performance of the model during training on a single GPU. This approach can help to avoid overfitting and underfitting, improving convergence speeds and overall model performance.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Evaluating Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of lightweight, adaptive learning rate schedulers in improving the training performance of AI models. Specifically, we aim to determine if these schedulers can enhance convergence speed, avoid overfitting and underfitting, and improve overall model performance on a single GPU.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Baseline Setup:**
   - Train models using standard learning rate schedulers (e.g., constant, step decay, and cosine annealing) to serve as baselines.

2. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler:**
   - Implement lightweight, adaptive learning rate schedulers that dynamically adjust the learning rate based on real-time model performance metrics such as validation loss and accuracy.

3. **Training Protocol:**
   - For each model and dataset, conduct multiple training runs:
     - 3 runs using standard schedulers.
     - 3 runs using the adaptive scheduler.
   - Ensure all other training parameters are held constant across runs.

4. **Data Collection:**
   - Track training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, validation accuracy, and learning rate at each epoch for all runs.

5. **Analysis:**
   - Compare convergence speeds by analyzing the number of epochs required to reach a predefined performance threshold.
   - Evaluate overfitting and underfitting by comparing the difference between training and validation metrics.
   - Perform statistical tests to determine if observed differences are significant.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10:** A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks, available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **IMDB Reviews:** A sentiment analysis dataset for natural language processing tasks, available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification:**
  - **ResNet-18:** A smaller variant of the ResNet architecture suitable for training on a single GPU.
- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - **BERT (base-uncased):** A transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of English text.

#### 5. Hyperparameters

  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 50
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Base Learning Rate: 0.001
