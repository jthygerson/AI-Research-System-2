# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers for Low-Resour

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers for Low-Resource Environments**: Develop a dynamic learning rate scheduler that adapts in real-time based on the computational resources available (e.g., single GPU) and the complexity of the dataset. The scheduler would optimize learning rates to balance between convergence speed and computational efficiency.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers for Low-Resource Environments

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts the learning rate in real-time based on the computational resources available and the complexity of the dataset. This scheduler aims to optimize the trade-off between convergence speed and computational efficiency, particularly in low-resource environments such as a single GPU setup.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Setup**:
    - Deploy a single GPU environment for all training tasks.
    - Select a diverse set of datasets varying in complexity to test the adaptive scheduler.
  
2. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler**:
    - Implement a dynamic learning rate scheduler that considers the following factors:
        - Current GPU utilization and memory.
        - Batch size.
        - Dataset complexity (e.g., number of classes, average number of features).
    - The scheduler will adjust the learning rate at each epoch or batch iteration based on the observed computational load and dataset characteristics.

3. **Training Process**:
    - Compare the adaptive learning rate scheduler with traditional schedulers (e.g., StepLR, ExponentialLR) using the same initial conditions.
    - Record training time, GPU usage, and convergence metrics for each configuration.

4. **Performance Analysis**:
    - Evaluate the models on held-out test sets.
    - Compare the efficiency and performance metrics of models trained with the adaptive scheduler against those trained with traditional schedulers.

   - Dataset ID: `ag_news`

4. **FashionMNIST**: An image classification dataset with 10 classes of clothing items.
   - Source: Hugging Face Datasets
   - Dataset ID: `fashion_mnist`

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-18
  - Suitable for CIFAR-10 and FashionMNIST datasets.
- **Text Classification**: BERT-base
  - Suitable for IMDB and AG News datasets.

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
1. **Convergence Speed**:
   - Time to reach a certain accuracy threshold (e.g., 90% for CIFAR-10).
2. **Final Accuracy**:
   - Accuracy on the test set after training completion.
3. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Average GPU utilization and memory usage during training.
4. **Training Time**:

By conducting this experiment, we aim to demonstrate the efficacy of an adaptive learning rate scheduler in optimizing both convergence speed and computational efficiency in low-resource environments. The results will highlight the potential benefits and any trade-offs associated with this adaptive approach.
