# Experiment Report: 2. **Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Small Mo

## Idea
2. **Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Small Models**: Design a streamlined knowledge distillation process that allows smaller neural networks to learn from larger, pretrained models using a minimal dataset. This project would focus on optimizing the transfer of knowledge by selectively distilling only the most critical layers and parameters, enhancing the smaller model's performance without requiring extensive training resources.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a streamlined knowledge distillation process that enables smaller neural networks to learn from larger, pretrained models using a minimal dataset. The focus will be on selectively distilling only the most critical layers and parameters to enhance the smaller model's performance without requiring extensive training resources.

### 2. Methodology
The experiment will involve the following steps:
1. **Model Selection**: Select a large, pretrained teacher model and a smaller student model.
2. **Layer and Parameter Selection**: Identify the most critical layers and parameters of the teacher model that will be used for distillation.
3. **Dataset Preparation**: Use a minimal dataset for the distillation process.
4. **Distillation Process**: Implement a distillation algorithm focusing on the selected layers and parameters to transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student model.
5. **Training**: Train the student model using the distilled knowledge and the minimal dataset.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the distilled student model using predefined metrics.

### 3. Datasets
For this experiment, we will use datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. (Dataset source: `huggingface/cifar10`)
- **AG News**: A dataset of news articles categorized into four classes (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). (Dataset source: `huggingface/ag_news`)

These datasets are chosen to cover both image and text domains.

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Teacher Model**: A large, pretrained model such as ResNet-50 for image classification (CIFAR-10) or BERT for text classification (AG News).
- **Student Model**: A smaller model such as MobileNetV2 for image classification or DistilBERT for text classification.

### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters for the distillation process are as follows:
- **Learning Rate**: `0.001`
- **Batch Size**: `32`
- **Number of Epochs**: `20`
- **Temperature**: `3` (for softening the logits)
- **Distillation Loss Weight**: `0.5`
- **Critical Layer Selection**: `last 3 layers` of the teacher model
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the distilled student model will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: Measure of the accuracy of the positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measure of the ability to find all relevant instances.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Inference Time**: Time taken to make predictions on the test set.
- **Model Size**: Total number of parameters in the student model.

By following this detailed experiment plan, we aim to determine the effectiveness of the proposed efficient knowledge distillation process in enhancing the performance of smaller models using minimal datasets.
