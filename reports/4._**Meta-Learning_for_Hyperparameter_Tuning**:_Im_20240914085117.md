## Idea
4. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement a meta-learning framework that quickly adapts to new tasks by automatically tuning hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures. This project should demonstrate that even with limited training time and computational resources, the framework can significantly enhance model performance across diverse datasets.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning

#### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning framework that can automatically and efficiently tune hyperparameters (such as learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures) to enhance the performance of machine learning models across diverse datasets. We aim to demonstrate that the framework can significantly improve model performance even with limited training time and computational resources.

#### 2. Methodology

1. **Meta-Learning Framework**: We will develop a meta-learning algorithm using techniques such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to adapt quickly to new tasks. The meta-learner will be trained to optimize hyperparameters for different tasks.

2. **Task Definition**: Each task will be defined as training a model on a specific dataset. The meta-learner will learn to optimize the hyperparameters for these tasks.

3. **Inner Loop**: In the inner loop, a base learner (e.g., a neural network) will be trained on a given task with a set of hyperparameters suggested by the meta-learner.

4. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop will update the meta-learner based on the performance of the base learner on validation data.

5. **Comparison**: We'll compare the performance of models trained with hyperparameters tuned by the meta-learning framework against models trained with manually or randomly selected hyperparameters.

#### 3. Datasets

We will use a variety of datasets from Hugging Face Datasets to ensure diversity and generalizability:

1. **Image Classification**:
   - CIFAR-10 (`"cifar10"` from Hugging Face Datasets)
   - MNIST (`"mnist"` from Hugging Face Datasets)

2. **Text Classification**:
   - IMDB (`"imdb"` from Hugging Face Datasets)
   - AG News (`"ag_news"` from Hugging Face Datasets)

3. **Tabular Data**:
   - Titanic (`"titanic"` from Hugging Face Datasets)
   - UCI Adult (`"adult"` from Hugging Face Datasets)

#### 4. Model Architecture

For this experiment, we will use different model architectures appropriate for each type of dataset:

1. **Image Classification**:
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-18 or simple CNN architectures.

2. **Text Classification**:
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as LSTM or GRU.
   - Transformers such as BERT (using `"bert-base-uncased"` from Hugging Face Transformers).

3. **Tabular Data**:
   - Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs).

#### 5. Hyperparameters

We will focus on tuning the following hyperparameters:

1. **Learning Rate**:
   - Initial learning rate: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]

2. **Batch Size**:
   - Batch sizes: [16, 32, 64]

3. **Network Architectures**:
   - Number of layers: [2, 3, 4]
   - Units per layer: [64, 128, 256]

4. **Optimizer**:
   - Optimizer types: ["adam", "sgd", "rmsprop"]

5. **Dropout Rates**:
   - Dropout rates: [0.2, 0.5]

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the models and the effectiveness of the meta-learning framework, we will use the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: For classification tasks, we will measure the accuracy of the models on the test set.

2. **Loss**: We will track the training and validation loss to monitor convergence and generalization.

3. **F1 Score**: For imbalanced datasets, F1 Score will provide a better measure of model performance.

4. **Training Time**: We will measure the total training time to evaluate the efficiency of the meta-learning framework.

5. **Computational Resources**: We will monitor the CPU/GPU usage and memory consumption to ensure the framework is resource-efficient.

6. **Hyperparameter Adaptation Speed**: We will assess how quickly the meta-learning framework converges to optimal hyperparameters.

By conducting this experiment, we aim to show that a meta-learning framework for hyperparameter tuning can effectively and efficiently improve model performance across various datasets and tasks.
