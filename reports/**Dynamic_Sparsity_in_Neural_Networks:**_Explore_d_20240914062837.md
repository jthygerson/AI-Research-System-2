# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Sparsity in Neural Networks:** Explore d

## Idea
**Dynamic Sparsity in Neural Networks:** Explore dynamic sparsity techniques where neural network connections are pruned and regrown during training based on their importance. Develop a simple algorithm that can be executed on a single GPU to dynamically adjust the network's sparsity, aiming to reduce computational requirements while keeping or enhancing model performance.

## Experiment Plan
### Dynamic Sparsity in Neural Networks Experiment

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate the effectiveness of dynamic sparsity techniques in neural networks. Specifically, we aim to dynamically prune and regrow neural network connections during training based on their importance. Our goal is to reduce computational requirements while maintaining or enhancing model performance. This approach will be tested on a single GPU to ensure its feasibility in standard research environments.

#### 2. Methodology
The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Model Initialization**: Initialize a dense neural network model.
2. **Dynamic Sparsity Algorithm**: Implement a dynamic sparsity algorithm that periodically prunes and regrows network connections based on their importance.
   - **Pruning**: Remove connections with the lowest weights or gradients.
   - **Regrowth**: Reintroduce connections in areas of the network that show high gradient magnitudes.
3. **Training Loop**: Integrate the dynamic sparsity algorithm into the standard training loop.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance and computational efficiency of the dynamically sparse model against a dense baseline model.

#### 3. Datasets
The experiment will be conducted using the following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)**: A collection of nine different NLP tasks for evaluating various NLP models.

#### 4. Model Architecture
We will use different model architectures tailored to each dataset:
1. **CIFAR-10**: ResNet-18, a residual network with 18 layers.
2. **MNIST**: LeNet-5, a simple convolutional neural network with 5 layers.
3. **GLUE**: BERT-base, a transformer model with 12 layers, 12 self-attention heads, and 110 million parameters.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters will be used and tuned for the experiment:
- **Learning Rate**: `0.001`
- **Batch Size**: `64`
- **Epochs**: `50`
- **Pruning Frequency**: `10` (number of epochs between pruning steps)
- **Pruning Rate**: `0.2` (fraction of connections to prune)
- **Regrowth Rate**: `0.2` (fraction of connections to regrow)
- **Sparsity Target**: `0.5` (target overall sparsity level in the network)
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics will be used to evaluate the model performance and computational efficiency:
1. **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified samples.
2. **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
3. **Inference Time**: Average time taken to make predictions on the test set.
4. **Model Size**: Number of non-zero parameters in the model.
5. **Training Time**: Total time required to train the model.
6. **GPU Memory Usage**: Peak memory usage during training.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to comprehensively evaluate the potential benefits and trade-offs of incorporating dynamic sparsity into neural network training.
