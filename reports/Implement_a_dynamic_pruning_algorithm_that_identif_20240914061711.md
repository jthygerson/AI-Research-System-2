# Experiment Report: Implement a dynamic pruning algorithm that identif

## Idea
Implement a dynamic pruning algorithm that identifies and removes redundant neurons and connections during training, rather than after. This approach should aim to maintain or improve model accuracy while significantly reducing computational load and memory usage.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a dynamic pruning algorithm that identifies and removes redundant neurons and connections during training. The goals are to maintain or improve model accuracy while significantly reducing computational load and memory usage.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Develop a dynamic pruning algorithm that operates during the training phase.
   - The algorithm will monitor neuron activations and gradients to identify redundancy in real-time.

2. **Experimental Design**:
   - Train models using standard training procedures (Baseline).
   - Train models with the dynamic pruning algorithm embedded (Pruned).
   - Compare the performance, computational load, and memory usage between the Baseline and Pruned models.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - Train both Baseline and Pruned models on the same datasets.
   - Use early stopping based on validation loss to avoid overfitting.
   - Log training time, number of parameters, and memory usage throughout the training process.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of model accuracy on test data.
   - Measure computational load through training time and FLOPs.
   - Measure memory usage by monitoring GPU/CPU memory usage.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets will be used, available on Hugging Face Datasets:

- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`cifar10`)
- **Natural Language Processing**: IMDB Reviews (`imdb`)
- **Speech Recognition**: Common Voice (`common_voice`)
- **Tabular Data**: Titanic Dataset (`titanic`)

Each dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets as per standard practice.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-18
- **Natural Language Processing**: BERT (Base)
- **Speech Recognition**: Wav2Vec 2.0
- **Tabular Data**: Fully Connected Neural Network (3 hidden layers)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Pruning Threshold**: 0.01 (probability of neuron redundancy)
- **Early Stopping Patience**: 5
- **Regularization**: L2 (0.0001)
- **Dropout**: 0.5 (for non-pruned models)

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measured on the test set to evaluate the model's performance.
- **F1 Score**: Especially for NLP tasks to account for class imbalance.
- **Training Time**: Total time taken to train the model.
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory usage during training.
- **Number of Parameters**: Total number of active parameters in the final model.
- **FLOPs**: Floating Point Operations per second to measure computational efficiency.

By comparing these metrics between the Baseline and Pruned models, the experiment aims to determine the effectiveness of the dynamic pruning algorithm in improving model efficiency without compromising accuracy.
