## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation in Low-Resource Scenarios

### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of meta-learning techniques in enabling AI models to quickly adapt to low-resource scenarios. Specifically, we will investigate whether models trained with meta-learning can achieve higher performance with limited labeled data compared to traditional training methods.

### 2. Methodology
The experiment will follow these steps:

1. **Pre-Training Phase:**
   - Use a large dataset to pre-train a base model.
   - Apply a meta-learning algorithm (e.g., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, MAML) to train the model on various tasks.

2. **Adaptation Phase:**
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained model on smaller, low-resource datasets using few-shot learning techniques.
   - Compare the performance of the meta-learned model to a traditionally trained model on the same low-resource datasets.

3. **Evaluation Phase:**
   - Assess the performance of both models using standard evaluation metrics.

### 3. Datasets
We will use the following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets:

- **Pre-Training Phase:**
  - **GLUE Benchmark** (General Language Understanding Evaluation): A collection of datasets for training and evaluating models on various NLP tasks.
    - `dataset_name: glue`
    - `tasks: CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability), SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank), etc.`

- **Adaptation Phase (Low-Resource Datasets):**
  - **TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) Question Classification**: A small dataset for question classification tasks.
    - `dataset_name: trec`
  - **FewRel**: A few-shot relation classification dataset.
    - `dataset_name: few_rel`
  - **CLINC150**: A dataset for intent classification with a subset used to simulate a low-resource setting.
    - `dataset_name: clinc_oos`

### 4. Model Architecture
We will use the following model architectures:

- **Pre-Training Phase:**
  - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of text.
    - `model_name: bert-base-uncased`

- **Adaptation Phase:**
  - **Meta-Learned Model**: A BERT model fine-tuned using MAML.
  - **Baseline Model**: A BERT model fine-tuned using traditional supervised learning.

### 5. Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters for both the pre-training and adaptation phases are as follows:

- **Pre-Training Phase (Meta-Learning with MAML):**
  - `learning_rate: 3e-5`
  - `meta_batch_size: 32`
  - `num_meta_iterations: 10000`
  - `inner_update_steps: 5`
  - `inner_learning_rate: 1e-3`

- **Adaptation Phase (Few-Shot Fine-Tuning):**
  - `learning_rate: 2e-5`
  - `batch_size: 16`
  - `num_epochs: 10`
  - `num_shots: 5, 10, 20` (different scenarios to test few-shot learning)

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
We will use the following evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **Adaptation Time**: The time taken for the model to adapt to the low-resource dataset.

The results will be compared between the meta-learned model and the baseline model to determine the effectiveness of meta-learning in low-resource scenarios.
