### Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment Using Meta-Learning Techniques

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic learning rate adjustments using meta-learning techniques in improving the performance of AI models. Specifically, the experiment aims to determine whether a meta-learning algorithm can effectively adapt the learning rate during training to optimize model performance compared to static or heuristically adjusted learning rates.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Training Setup:** 
   - Implement a meta-learning algorithm (e.g., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)) to dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training of a primary model.
   - Use a control group where the learning rate is adjusted using traditional methods (e.g., fixed schedule or cyclical learning rates).

2. **Meta-Learning Mechanism:**
   - The meta-learner will take as input:
     - Current state of the primary model (weights, gradients)
     - Performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy)
   - It will output an optimal learning rate for the next iteration.

3. **Training Phases:**
   - **Phase 1:** Train the meta-learner on a subset of the training data.
   - **Phase 2:** Use the meta-learner to adjust the learning rate dynamically for the primary model on the main training data.

4. **Comparison:**
   - Compare the performance of the primary model with dynamic learning rates adjusted by the meta-learner against models with static or heuristically adjusted learning rates.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Primary Dataset:** CIFAR-10 (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `hf::cifar10`)
- **Meta-Learning Training Subset:** A subset of CIFAR-10 for training the meta-learner.
- **Validation and Test Sets:** Separate portions of CIFAR-10 for validation and testing purposes to ensure there is no data leakage.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Primary Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Input Layer: 32x32x3 (matching CIFAR-10 image dimensions)
  - Convolutional Layers: 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activations, followed by max-pooling layers
  - Fully Connected Layers: 2 fully connected layers with ReLU activations
  - Output Layer: Softmax layer with 10 outputs (for 10 classes in CIFAR-10)

- **Meta-Learner Model:** Simple Feedforward Neural Network
  - Input Layer: Corresponding to the primary model's state and performance metrics
  - Hidden Layers: 2 hidden layers with ReLU activations
  - Output Layer: Single neuron with linear activation (to output the learning rate)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Primary Model Hyperparameters:**
  - Initial Learning Rate: 0.01
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 50
  - Optimizer: SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
  
- **Meta-Learner Hyperparameters:**
  - Learning Rate for Meta-Learner: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 20
  - Optimizer: Adam

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary Model Performance Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified images on the test set.
  - Loss: Cross-entropy loss on the test set.

- **Training Efficiency Metrics:**
  - Convergence Speed: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold.
  - Stability: Variance in accuracy and loss over the last 10 epochs.

- **Meta-Learner Performance Metrics:**
  - Learning Rate Adjustment Effectiveness: Improvement in primary model's performance metrics when using dynamic learning rates versus static/heuristic learning rates.

The success of the experiment will be determined by the primary model's improved performance (higher accuracy and lower loss) and greater training efficiency (faster convergence and stability) when using the dynamically adjusted learning rates from the meta-learner compared to static or heuristically adjusted learning rates.
