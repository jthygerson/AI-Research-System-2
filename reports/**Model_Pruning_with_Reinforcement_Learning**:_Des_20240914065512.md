# Experiment Report: **Model Pruning with Reinforcement Learning**: Des

## Idea
**Model Pruning with Reinforcement Learning**: Design a reinforcement learning-based approach to model pruning, where an agent learns to remove less critical neurons or layers from a neural network. The agent's reward signal would be based on a combination of model accuracy and computational efficiency, aiming to achieve a leaner model with minimal performance trade-offs.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Model Pruning with Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach for model pruning. The RL agent will learn to remove less critical neurons or layers from a neural network, balancing between maintaining model accuracy and improving computational efficiency. This approach aims to produce a leaner model with minimal performance trade-offs.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Agent Design**: Construct an RL agent using a policy gradient method (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) which interacts with a neural network to decide which neurons or layers to prune.
2. **Environment**: Define the environment where the state is the current architecture of the neural network and the action is the decision to prune specific neurons or layers.
3. **Reward Signal**: Design a reward function based on a combination of model accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., FLOPs or inference time).
4. **Training Process**:
    - Pre-train a neural network on a given dataset to establish a baseline performance.
    - Initialize the RL agent and environment.
    - Let the agent interact with the network by iteratively pruning and retraining the network, collecting rewards after each action.
    - Update the agent's policy based on the collected rewards to maximize the long-term reward.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10**: 
  - Input layer: 32x32x3
  - Conv layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel
  - Conv layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel
  - MaxPooling layer: 2x2
  - Dense layer: 512 units
  - Output layer: 10 units (Softmax)

- **LSTM Network for IMDB**:
  - Input layer: Sequence of word embeddings
  - LSTM layer: 128 units
  - Dense layer: 64 units
  - Output layer: 1 unit (Sigmoid)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**:
  - Learning rate: 0.0003
  - Discount factor (gamma): 0.99
  - PPO clip parameter: 0.2
  - Number of epochs: 10
  - Batch size: 64

- **Neural Network**:
  - Initial learning rate: 0.001
  - Learning rate decay: 0.0001
  - Batch size: 128
  - Number of epochs (for pre-training): 50

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Model Accuracy**: Measure the classification accuracy on the validation dataset before and after pruning.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Evaluate the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time before and after pruning.
- **Model Size**: Measure the total number of parameters before and after pruning.
- **Pruning Ratio**: Percentage of neurons/layers pruned by the RL agent.
- **Trade-off Score**: A combined metric that balances accuracy and computational efficiency (e.g., Accuracy * (1 / FLOPs)).

By following this experiment plan, we aim to determine the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in model pruning and its potential to create more efficient neural networks without significantly sacrificing performance.
