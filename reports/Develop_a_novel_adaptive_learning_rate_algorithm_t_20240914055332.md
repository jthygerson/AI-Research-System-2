5. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor computational resource usage (e.g., CPU/GPU utilization, memory usage) throughout the training process to ensure the algorithm's efficiency.

#### 3. Datasets
The following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets will be used:
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits for image classification.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification of movie reviews.
- **AG News**: A dataset for text classification, consisting of news articles categorized into four classes.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **For MNIST**: A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 2 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers.
- **For IMDB**: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with an embedding layer, followed by an LSTM layer, and a fully connected output layer.
