# Experiment Report: 4. **Transfer Learning with Domain Adaptation**: D

## Idea
4. **Transfer Learning with Domain Adaptation**: Design a streamlined transfer learning approach that leverages pre-trained models on similar tasks but includes a domain adaptation module to better fit the target task. This can be tested on a single GPU by fine-tuning a smaller model or subset of layers, aiming to boost performance with limited additional training.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Transfer Learning with Domain Adaptation

---

#### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the efficacy of a transfer learning approach that leverages pre-trained models on similar tasks and includes a domain adaptation module to better fit the target task. We aim to test whether this approach can improve performance with limited additional training on a single GPU by fine-tuning a smaller model or a subset of layers.

#### 2. Methodology

1. **Pre-trained Model Selection**:
   - Select a pre-trained model on a task similar to the target task.
   - Example: Use BERT pre-trained on general language understanding tasks.

2. **Domain Adaptation Module Design**:
   - Implement a domain adaptation module that can learn domain-specific features.
   - Example: Add a few domain-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model.

3. **Fine-tuning Strategy**:
   - Fine-tune only the domain adaptation module and the last few layers of the pre-trained model to reduce computational costs.

4. **Training**:
   - Train the model on the target task dataset using a single GPU.
   - Utilize techniques like learning rate scheduling and early stopping to optimize training.

5. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the performance of the proposed transfer learning approach with a baseline model fine-tuned without the domain adaptation module.
