# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment using Meta-Lear

## Idea
**Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment using Meta-Learning**: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training based on the loss landscape. This approach aims to speed up convergence and improve model performance without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment using Meta-Learning

### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of a neural network during training based on the loss landscape. By doing so, we aim to:
- Speed up the convergence of the training process.
- Improve the overall performance of the model.
- Reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. Methodology

#### Algorithm Development
1. **Meta-Learning Algorithm**:
   - Design a meta-learner that takes as input the current loss, gradients, and other relevant metrics (e.g., gradient norm, second-order gradient information).
   - The meta-learner will output an adjusted learning rate for the primary neural network to use in the next training step.
   - The meta-learner could be implemented using a small neural network or a reinforcement learning algorithm.

2. **Primary Learner**:
   - Train a standard neural network on a given task.
   - Use the dynamically adjusted learning rate provided by the meta-learner during training.

3. **Training Procedure**:
   - Initialize the primary learner and the meta-learner.
   - At each training step, compute the loss and gradients of the primary learner.
   - Pass the loss and gradients to the meta-learner to obtain the updated learning rate.
   - Update the primary learner's parameters using the adjusted learning rate.
   - Periodically update the meta-learner based on its performance in adjusting the learning rate.

#### Experimental Design
- Compare the performance of the dynamically adjusted learning rate approach with several fixed learning rates and other adaptive learning rate methods (e.g., Adam, RMSprop).
- Conduct multiple runs for statistical significance.

### 3. Datasets
Select diverse datasets to evaluate the generality of the approach:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used image classification dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`cifar10`)
   
2. **IMDB Reviews**: A large dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
   - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`imdb`)
   
3. **MNIST**: Handwritten digit classification dataset with 70,000 28x28 grayscale images in 10 classes.
   - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`mnist`)

### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - For CIFAR-10 and MNIST
   - Example architecture: 
     ```python
     model = Sequential([
         Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
         MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
         Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
         MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
         Flatten(),
         Dense(128, activation='relu'),
         Dense(10, activation='softmax')
     ])
     ```

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM**:
   - For IMDB Reviews
   - Example architecture:
     ```python
     model = Sequential([
         Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128),
         LSTM(128, return_sequences=True),
         LSTM(128),
         Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
     ])
     ```

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Meta-Learner**:
  - Learning rate: `1e-4`
  - Gradient clipping: `1.0`

- **Primary Learner (initial values)**:
  - Initial learning rate: `1e-3`
  - Batch size: `64`
  - Epochs: `50`
  - Optimizer: `SGD` for baseline comparisons

- **Fixed Learning Rate Baselines**:
  - Learning rates: `[1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2]`

- **Adaptive Learning Rate Baselines**:
  - Adam: `learning_rate=1e-3`
  - RMSprop: `learning_rate=1e-3`

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances over the total instances.
- **Loss**: The value of the loss function on the test set.
- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a specified accuracy threshold.
- **Learning Rate Path**: The trajectory of the learning rate during training to analyze the behavior of the meta-learner.

### Summary
This experiment aims to develop a meta-learning algorithm for dynamic learning rate adjustment and evaluate its performance across different datasets and model architectures. By comparing against fixed and other adaptive learning rate methods, we aim to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving convergence speed and model performance.
