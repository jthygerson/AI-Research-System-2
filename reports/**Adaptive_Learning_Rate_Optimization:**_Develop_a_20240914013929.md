## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization:** Develop a lightweight, adaptive learning rate scheduler that can dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the model's performance metrics during training. This could involve using simple heuristics or rule-based systems to fine-tune learning rates in real-time without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive learning rate scheduler that can dynamically adjust the learning rate based on real-time performance metrics during training. The hypothesis is that this adaptive approach will lead to faster convergence and potentially better model performance compared to traditional fixed or pre-defined learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler Development**: Develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that uses simple heuristics or rule-based adjustments. For instance, if the validation loss decreases significantly, the learning rate might be slightly increased to accelerate learning. Conversely, if the validation loss plateaus or increases, the learning rate might be decreased.
  
- **Baseline Comparison**: Use standard learning rate schedulers such as StepLR, ExponentialLR, and ReduceLROnPlateau as baselines.

- **Training Procedure**: Train identical models using both the adaptive learning rate scheduler and the baseline schedulers. Each model will be trained for a fixed number of epochs or until convergence.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics such as training loss, validation loss, and accuracy at each epoch.

- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that all experiments are run with fixed random seeds to ensure reproducibility.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews.
- **Hugging Face Datasets**: These datasets are available via the Hugging Face Datasets library and can be accessed using the following identifiers:
  - `cifar10` for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  - `imdb` for the IMDB Reviews dataset.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **CIFAR-10**: Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture such as ResNet-18.
- **IMDB Reviews**: Use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture such as LSTM or a Transformer-based model like BERT.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate (Initial)**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Baseline Schedulers**:
  - **StepLR**: `{'step_size': 10, 'gamma': 0.1}`
  - **ExponentialLR**: `{'gamma': 0.95}`
  - **ReduceLROnPlateau**: `{'mode': 'min', 'factor': 0.1, 'patience': 5}`
- **Adaptive Scheduler**:
  - **Initial Adjustment Factor**: 0.1
  - **Performance Threshold**: 0.01 (percentage change in validation loss to trigger adjustment)
  - **Adjustment Frequency**: Every epoch

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Loss**: The loss value on the training dataset.
- **Validation Loss**: The loss value on the validation dataset.
- **Accuracy**: The classification accuracy on the validation dataset.
- **Convergence Time**: The number of epochs taken to reach the best validation loss.
- **Learning Rate Dynamics**: The variation of the learning rate over epochs.

By following this detailed experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the effectiveness of the adaptive learning rate scheduler in improving model training performance and efficiency compared to traditional learning rate schedules.
