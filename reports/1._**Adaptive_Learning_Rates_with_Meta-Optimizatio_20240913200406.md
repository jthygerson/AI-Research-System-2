# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rates with Meta-Optimizatio

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rates with Meta-Optimization**: Develop a novel meta-optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts learning rates during training based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics. This algorithm should be lightweight and designed to work efficiently on a single GPU, ensuring that training convergence is accelerated without a significant increase in computational overhead.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Testing Adaptive Learning Rates with Meta-Optimization

### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel meta-optimization algorithm designed to dynamically adjust learning rates during training based on real-time feedback from the model's performance metrics. The goal is to determine if this algorithm can accelerate training convergence without increasing computational overhead, especially when implemented on a single GPU.

### 2. Methodology
#### 2.1 Meta-Optimization Algorithm
- Develop the meta-optimization algorithm to adjust learning rates in real-time.
- Integrate the algorithm into the training loop of a neural network.
- Ensure the algorithm is lightweight to maintain efficiency on a single GPU.

#### 2.2 Experimental Setup
- Use a controlled setup where the only variable is the type of learning rate adjustment (static vs. adaptive).
- Train models with standard static learning rates and compare them to models using the adaptive learning rates with meta-optimization.
- Run multiple trials to ensure statistical significance.

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10 and CNN for MNIST.
- **Text Classification**: BERT base model for IMDB Reviews.

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Initial Learning Rate**: 0.01 (static) / 0.01 (adaptive starting point)
- **Number of Epochs**: 50
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Weight Decay**: 1e-4
- **Meta-Optimization Update Frequency**: Every batch
- **Meta-Optimization Learning Rate**: 0.001

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Training Time**: Measure the total time taken to complete training.
- **Convergence Epoch**: The epoch at which the model achieves a pre-defined performance threshold (e.g., 90% accuracy).
- **Final Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model on the test set after training.
- **Loss**: The cross-entropy loss on the test set.
- **Computational Overhead**: Measure the additional computational time or resources consumed by the adaptive learning rate algorithm.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Baseline Training**: Train the models on each dataset using static learning rates.
2. **Adaptive Training**: Train the models on each dataset using the proposed adaptive learning rate algorithm.
3. **Data Collection**: Record the training time, convergence epoch, final accuracy, loss, and computational overhead for each trial.
4. **Analysis**: Compare the performance metrics of the baseline and adaptive models to evaluate the effectiveness of the meta-optimization algorithm.
5. **Statistical Significance**: Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-test) to determine if the differences observed are significant.

By following this plan, we aim to rigorously test the hypothesis that adaptive learning rates, adjusted via a novel meta-optimization algorithm, can improve training efficiency and model performance without incurring significant computational costs.
