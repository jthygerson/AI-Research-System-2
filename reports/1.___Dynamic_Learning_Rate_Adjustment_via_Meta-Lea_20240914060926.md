## Experiment Plan: Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment via Meta-Learning

### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to test whether dynamic learning rate adjustment via meta-learning can improve the performance of an AI research system. Specifically, we aim to:
- Develop a meta-learning framework that adjusts the learning rate of a base model in real-time.
- Compare the performance of this dynamically adjusted learning rate model against a model with a static learning rate.
- Assess improvements in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and overall model robustness.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Setup Meta-Learning Framework:**
   - Use a meta-learner (e.g., a smaller neural network or an LSTM) to predict the optimal learning rate for the base model at each training step.
   - Train the meta-learner concurrently with the base model.

2. **Training Process:**
   - Initialize both the base model and the meta-learner.
   - For each batch of training data:
     - Use the meta-learner to predict the learning rate for the base model.
     - Update the base model using the predicted learning rate.
     - Update the meta-learner based on the performance of the base model (e.g., using the loss gradient).
  
3. **Comparison Setup:**
   - Train a control model with a static learning rate using standard techniques.
   - Compare convergence speed, accuracy, and robustness on a validation set.

### 3. Datasets
We will use the following datasets from Hugging Face Datasets:
- **Text Classification:** `ag_news` - A dataset for news categorization.
- **Image Classification:** `cifar10` - A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **Tabular Data:** `titanic` - A dataset with information about passengers aboard the Titanic, used for binary classification.

### 4. Model Architecture

#### Base Models:
- **Text Classification:** 
  - Model: `bert-base-uncased`
  - Architecture: Transformer-based model for text classification.
- **Image Classification:**
  - Model: ResNet-18
  - Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with residual connections.
- **Tabular Data:**
  - Model: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Architecture: Fully connected neural network with 3 hidden layers.

#### Meta-Learner:
- **Architecture:** 
  - If using a neural network: A simple 3-layer MLP.
  - If using an LSTM: A single LSTM layer followed by a dense output layer.

### 5. Hyperparameters

#### Base Model Hyperparameters:
- **Text Classification (BERT):**
  - Learning Rate: 5e-5 (for baseline)
  - Batch Size: 16
  - Epochs: 3
- **Image Classification (ResNet-18):**
  - Learning Rate: 0.01 (for baseline)
  - Batch Size: 128
  - Epochs: 20
- **Tabular Data (MLP):**
  - Learning Rate: 0.001 (for baseline)
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 50

#### Meta-Learner Hyperparameters:
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-3 (for training the meta-learner)
- **Batch Size:** Same as base model
- **Optimizer:** Adam

#### Shared Hyperparameters:
- **Meta-Update Frequency:** After every batch
- **Meta-Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and optimal learning rate

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Convergence Speed:** Number of epochs or iterations required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold.
- **Accuracy:** Final accuracy on the validation set.
- **Loss:** Final loss on the validation set.
- **Robustness:** Performance on perturbed or noisy validation sets to test for model robustness.

By comparing the performance of the dynamically adjusted learning rate model and the static learning rate model across these metrics, we can determine the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic learning rate adjustment via meta-learning.
