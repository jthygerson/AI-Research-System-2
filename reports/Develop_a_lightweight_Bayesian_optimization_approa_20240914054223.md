# Experiment Report: Develop a lightweight Bayesian optimization approa

## Idea
Develop a lightweight Bayesian optimization approach that leverages meta-learning to quickly adapt hyperparameters based on prior knowledge from similar tasks. This can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for tuning, making it feasible to achieve optimal performance with limited computational resources.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a lightweight Bayesian optimization approach that leverages meta-learning to quickly adapt hyperparameters based on prior knowledge from similar tasks. The goal is to determine if this approach can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for hyperparameter tuning, thereby achieving optimal performance with limited computational resources.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will be divided into several key steps:

1. **Task Collection**: Collect a set of similar tasks from diverse but related domains to build a meta-learning dataset.
2. **Meta-Feature Extraction**: Extract meta-features from each task to facilitate the transfer of knowledge.
3. **Meta-Model Training**: Train a meta-learning model to predict optimal hyperparameters based on the extracted meta-features.
4. **Bayesian Optimization**: Implement a lightweight Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages the meta-learning model.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the proposed approach against traditional Bayesian optimization and random search.

#### 3. Datasets
The datasets will be sourced from Hugging Face Datasets, focusing on a mix of tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. Example datasets include:

- **AG News**: A dataset for text classification.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
- **CoNLL-2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition.

#### 4. Model Architecture
The models used in this experiment will be well-established architectures suitable for the chosen tasks:

- **Text Classification**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: DistilBERT (a smaller, faster, cheaper version of BERT)
- **Named Entity Recognition**: BERT with a token classification head

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters for tuning will include:

- **Learning Rate**: {1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5}
- **Batch Size**: {16, 32}
- **Number of Epochs**: {3, 5, 10}
- **Dropout Rate**: {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}
- **Warmup Steps**: {0, 100, 500}

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Text Classification**: Accuracy, F1-Score
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Accuracy, F1-Score
- **Named Entity Recognition**: F1-Score, Precision, Recall

Additional metrics to evaluate the optimization process include:

- **Number of Iterations**: The number of iterations needed to converge to the optimal hyperparameters.
- **Computational Cost**: The total computational resources (e.g., GPU hours) consumed during hyperparameter tuning.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the proposed lightweight Bayesian optimization approach with meta-learning and assess its feasibility and effectiveness in reducing the computational resources required for hyperparameter tuning in AI/ML models.

**Original Code:**
```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          
    num_train_epochs=1,

    weight_decay=0.01,               
    logging_dir='./logs',

    warmup_steps=500,                
    weight_decay=0.01,               
    logging_dir='./logs',

    compute_metrics=compute_metrics      # Add custom metrics calculation
)

# Implement learning rate scheduler
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=training_args.learning_rate)
scheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=training_args.warmup_steps, num_training_steps=len(train_dataset) * training_args.num_train_epochs)

trainer.train()

# Implement data_collator and compute_metrics
from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding

data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer)

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    accuracy = np.sum(predictions == labels) / len(labels)
    return {"accuracy": accuracy}
```
