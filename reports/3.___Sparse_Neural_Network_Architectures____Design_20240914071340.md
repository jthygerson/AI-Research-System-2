# Experiment Report: 3. **Sparse Neural Network Architectures**: Design

## Idea
3. **Sparse Neural Network Architectures**: Design and test sparse neural network architectures that maintain high performance with fewer parameters and computations. Explore methods for dynamically pruning and re-growing connections during training to achieve an optimal balance between model complexity and computational efficiency.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Sparse Neural Network Architectures

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to investigate whether sparse neural network architectures can maintain high performance while reducing the number of parameters and computational overhead. Specifically, we aim to explore methods for dynamically pruning and re-growing connections during training to find an optimal balance between model complexity and computational efficiency.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Model Setup**: Train a dense neural network as a baseline.
2. **Pruning**: Implement a pruning strategy during training to remove less significant weights.
3. **Dynamic Re-growth**: Introduce a mechanism to re-grow pruned connections based on certain criteria (e.g., gradient-based metrics).
4. **Training Regime**: Alternate between pruning and re-growing phases throughout the training process.
5. **Performance Comparison**: Compare the sparse model's performance, computational cost, and parameter count with the baseline dense model.

#### 3. Datasets
The experiments will be conducted using the following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
- **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: A reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a segment of text from the corresponding passage.

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **CIFAR-10**: ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network with 18 layers.
- **IMDB**: LSTM-based model for text classification.
- **SQuAD**: BERT-base for question-answering tasks.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Pruning Frequency**: Every 5 epochs
- **Pruning Ratio**: 20% of the smallest weights
- **Re-growth Strategy**: Add back 10% of the pruned weights based on gradient magnitude
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Weight Initialization**: Xavier Initialization

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances (for CIFAR-10 and IMDB).
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall (for IMDB).
- **Exact Match (EM)**: Measures the percentage of predictions that match any one of the ground truth answers exactly (for SQuAD).
- **F1 Score (for SQuAD)**: Measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth answer.
- **Model Size**: Number of parameters in the model.
- **Inference Time**: Time taken to make a prediction.
- **Computational Cost**: Floating-point operations per second (FLOPs).

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the hypothesis that sparse neural network architectures, with dynamic pruning and re-growth, can achieve a balance between high performance and computational efficiency.
