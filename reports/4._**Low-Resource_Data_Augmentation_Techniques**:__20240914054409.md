# Experiment Report: 4. **Low-Resource Data Augmentation Techniques**: 

## Idea
4. **Low-Resource Data Augmentation Techniques**: Develop and evaluate simple yet effective data augmentation techniques tailored for small datasets that can be implemented without heavy computational demands. These techniques should aim to improve the generalization and robustness of AI models by artificially expanding the diversity of training data.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Low-Resource Data Augmentation Techniques for Small Datasets

#### 1. Objective
To develop and evaluate simple yet effective data augmentation techniques tailored for small datasets that can be implemented without heavy computational demands. The goal is to improve the generalization and robustness of AI models by artificially expanding the diversity of training data.

#### 2. Methodology
The experiment will consist of the following steps:
1. **Baseline Model Training**: Train baseline models on original small datasets without any data augmentation.
2. **Develop Augmentation Techniques**: Create a set of low-resource data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, rotation, adding noise, synonym replacement, etc.
3. **Augmented Data Training**: Train models on datasets augmented using the developed techniques.
4. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of models trained on original and augmented datasets using established evaluation metrics.

The augmentation techniques will include:
- **Image Data**: Random cropping, rotation, flipping, color jittering, and adding Gaussian noise.
- **Text Data**: Synonym replacement, random insertion, random deletion, and random swapping.

#### 3. Datasets
We will use small, publicly available datasets from Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **Image Dataset**: 
   - **CIFAR-10 (Subset)**: A small subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset containing 10,000 images (1,000 per class).

2. **Text Dataset**: 
   - **IMDb (Subset)**: A small subset of the IMDb dataset containing 5,000 movie reviews with binary sentiment labels (positive/negative).

#### 4. Model Architecture
1. **For Image Data**:
   - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A simple CNN with the following architecture:
     - Conv Layer (32 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
     - Max Pooling (2x2)
     - Conv Layer (64 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
     - Max Pooling (2x2)
     - Fully Connected Layer (128 units, ReLU)
     - Output Layer (10 units, Softmax)

2. **For Text Data**:
   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A simple LSTM model with the following architecture:
     - Embedding Layer (vocab_size=5000, embed_dim=128)
     - LSTM Layer (128 units)
     - Fully Connected Layer (64 units, ReLU)
     - Output Layer (1 unit, Sigmoid)

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **For CNN Model**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 20
  - Optimizer: Adam
  
- **For LSTM Model**:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Epochs: 10
  - Optimizer: Adam

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances among the total instances.
2. **Precision**: The proportion of true positive results to the total number of positive results (true positives + false positives).
3. **Recall**: The proportion of true positive results to the total number of actual positives (true positives + false negatives).
4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
5. **Loss**: The categorical cross-entropy for image data and binary cross-entropy for text data.
