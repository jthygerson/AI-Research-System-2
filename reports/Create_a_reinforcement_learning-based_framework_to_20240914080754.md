# Experiment Report: Create a reinforcement learning-based framework to

## Idea
Create a reinforcement learning-based framework to automatically generate and select the most effective data augmentation strategies in real-time. The RL agent would evaluate the impact of various augmentation techniques on the model's performance and optimize the augmentation pipeline to enhance generalization and robustness.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to automatically generate and select the most effective data augmentation strategies in real-time. The goal is to enhance the model's generalization and robustness by optimizing the augmentation pipeline, thereby improving overall performance.

### 2. Methodology
1. **RL Framework Design**:
   - **Agent**: The RL agent will be designed to select data augmentation techniques from a predefined set of options.
   - **State**: The state will represent the current performance of the model, including metrics such as accuracy, loss, and any other relevant statistics.
   - **Action**: Actions will correspond to the application of different augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, cropping, scaling, color jittering).
   - **Reward**: The reward will be based on the improvement in model performance metrics after applying an augmentation technique.

2. **Training Loop**:
   - Initialize the RL agent with a random policy.
   - Train a baseline model on the original dataset without any augmentation.
   - Iteratively apply augmentation techniques as chosen by the RL agent.
   - Train the model on the augmented dataset.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and provide feedback to the RL agent.
   - Update the RL policy based on the reward received.

3. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Compare the RL-optimized augmentation pipeline with traditional, manually designed augmentation pipelines.

### 3. Datasets
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.
2. **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits in 10 classes. Available on Hugging Face Datasets.

### 4. Model Architecture
1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - **Input Layer**: Convolutional layer with 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation.
   - **Hidden Layers**: 
     - Convolutional layer with 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation.
     - Max-pooling layer, pool size 2x2.
     - Convolutional layer with 128 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation.
     - Max-pooling layer, pool size 2x2.
     - Fully connected layer with 512 units, ReLU activation.
   - **Output Layer**: Fully connected layer with 10 units (for CIFAR-10 and MNIST), softmax activation.

### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Discount Factor (γ)**: 0.99
- **Exploration Rate (ε)**: Start at 1.0 and decay to 0.01
- **Replay Buffer Size**: 100,000
- **Target Network Update Frequency**: 10 episodes
- **Optimizer**: Adam

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
2. **Loss**: Cross-entropy loss to measure the difference between the predicted and actual class distributions.
3. **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall to evaluate the balance between them.
4. **Robustness**: Performance of the model on adversarially perturbed data.
5. **Generalization**: Performance of the model on an unseen validation dataset.

By following this experimental plan, we aim to validate whether the RL-based framework can effectively optimize data augmentation strategies to improve the performance, generalization, and robustness of AI models.

## Code Changes

### File: train.py
**Original Code:**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.01
batch_size = 64
num_epochs = 10

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Training code here
    pass
```
**Updated Code:**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the model with Dropout
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(0.2)  # Add dropout
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(0.2)  # Add dropout
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout1(x)  # Apply dropout
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.dropout2(x)  # Apply dropout
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModel()

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.001  # Decreased learning rate
batch_size = 128       # Increased batch size
num_epochs = 20        # Increased number of epochs

# Use Adam optimizer for better performance
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
