# Experiment Report: **Dynamic Model Pruning using Reinforcement Learni

## Idea
**Dynamic Model Pruning using Reinforcement Learning**: Develop a reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically prunes less important neurons and connections in neural networks during training, rather than after training. This approach could reduce the computational resources required for training and inference without significantly compromising model performance.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Dynamic Model Pruning using Reinforcement Learning

---

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically prunes neurons and connections in neural networks during training. The goal is to reduce computational resources required for training and inference while maintaining or slightly compromising the model's performance.

---

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1**: Develop a reinforcement learning agent that can interact with the neural network during the training process. The agent will decide which neurons and connections to prune based on predefined criteria.
- **Step 2**: Integrate the RL agent with the training loop of the neural network. The agent will observe the network's state (e.g., activation levels, gradients) and take actions (pruning decisions) at specific intervals.
- **Step 3**: Define a reward function for the RL agent that balances the trade-off between model performance (accuracy, loss) and computational efficiency (number of parameters, FLOPs).
- **Step 4**: Train the neural network with the RL agent in the loop on selected datasets.
- **Step 5**: Evaluate the pruned model's performance and compare it with a baseline model trained without dynamic pruning.
