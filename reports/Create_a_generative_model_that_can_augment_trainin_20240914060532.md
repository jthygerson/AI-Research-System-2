# Experiment Report: Create a generative model that can augment trainin

## Idea
Create a generative model that can augment training datasets on-the-fly by generating realistic yet diverse samples. The model should be trained to produce variations that improve the robustness and generalization of the AI system, all while operating efficiently on a single GPU.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a generative model in augmenting training datasets on-the-fly. The goal is to determine whether this approach can improve the robustness and generalization of an AI Research System, while maintaining computational efficiency on a single GPU.

### 2. Methodology

The experiment will be conducted in the following steps:

1. **Baseline Model Training**: Train a baseline AI model using the original dataset without any augmentation.
2. **Generative Model Training**: Train a generative model to create realistic yet diverse samples based on the original dataset.
3. **Augmentation and Training**: Use the generative model to augment the training dataset on-the-fly during the training of the AI model.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the AI model trained with augmented data to the baseline model in terms of robustness and generalization.

### 3. Datasets

The datasets selected for this experiment are available on Hugging Face Datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
2. **IMDB Reviews**: A dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews for binary sentiment classification.

### 4. Model Architecture

#### Baseline AI Models

- **Image Classification**: ResNet-18
- **Text Classification**: BERT-base-uncased

#### Generative Models

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

#### Image Classification

- **Accuracy**: Measure the proportion of correctly classified images.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Robustness**: Evaluate model performance on perturbed/test-time augmented images.

#### Text Classification

- **Accuracy**: Measure the proportion of correctly classified reviews.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Generalization**: Performance on a hold-out test set that includes diverse review samples.

### Execution Plan

1. **Baseline Model Training**:
   - Train ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 and BERT-base-uncased on IMDB Reviews.
   - Record baseline performance metrics.

2. **Generative Model Training**:
   - Train DCGAN on CIFAR-10 and GPT-2 on IMDB Reviews to generate new samples.
   - Ensure that the generative model can produce realistic and diverse samples.

3. **Augmentation and Training**:
   - During the training of ResNet-18 and BERT, augment the dataset on-the-fly using the generative models.
   - Train the AI models with the augmented datasets.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the augmented models' performance with the baseline metrics.
   - Evaluate robustness and generalization improvements.

By the end of this experiment, we aim to determine if on-the-fly data augmentation using generative models can significantly enhance the performance, robustness, and generalization of AI systems while being computationally efficient on a single GPU.
