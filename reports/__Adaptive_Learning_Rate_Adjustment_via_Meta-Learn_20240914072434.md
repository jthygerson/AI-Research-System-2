# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Adjustment via Meta-Learn

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Adjustment via Meta-Learning**: Develop an adaptive learning rate adjustment mechanism using meta-learning techniques. The goal is to create a lightweight meta-learner that can dynamically adjust the learning rates of different layers in a neural network during training, optimizing convergence speed and final accuracy without extensive manual tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan for Adaptive Learning Rate Adjustment via Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate an adaptive learning rate adjustment mechanism using meta-learning techniques. The goal is to create a lightweight meta-learner that can dynamically adjust the learning rates of different layers in a neural network during training, thereby optimizing convergence speed and final accuracy without extensive manual tuning.

#### 2. Methodology
**Step 1: Meta-Learner Design**
- Design a meta-learner that takes as input the current gradients and learning rates of each layer of the primary neural network (base-learner).
- The meta-learner will output adjusted learning rates for each layer.

**Step 2: Integrate Meta-Learner with Base-Learner**
- Update the training loop of the base-learner to include the meta-learner's adjustments to the learning rates after each batch.

**Step 3: Training and Validation Pipeline**
- Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train the base-learner using standard learning rate schedules as a baseline.
- Train the base-learner using the meta-learner for adaptive learning rate adjustment.

**Step 4: Comparison and Evaluation**
- Compare the performance of the base-learner with and without the meta-learner in terms of convergence speed and final accuracy.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
  - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`cifar10`)
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification, containing 50,000 movie reviews.
  - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`imdb`)
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, containing 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits.
  - Source: Hugging Face Datasets (`mnist`)

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Image Classification (CIFAR-10, MNIST)**:
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Conv Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
    - Conv Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
    - MaxPooling Layer: 2x2
    - Dropout Layer: 0.25
    - Fully Connected Layer: 128 units, ReLU activation
    - Output Layer: 10 units, Softmax activation

  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM
    - Embedding Layer: 100 dimensions
    - LSTM Layer: 128 units
    - Dropout Layer: 0.2
    - Fully Connected Layer: 1 unit, Sigmoid activation

#### 5. Hyperparameters
- **Base-Learner Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning Rate (initial): 0.001
  - Batch Size: 64
  - Epochs: 50 for CIFAR-10 and MNIST, 20 for IMDB
  - Optimizer: Adam

- **Meta-Learner Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning Rate for Meta-Learner: 0.01
  - Meta-Learner Model: Small Feed-Forward Neural Network
    - Input Layer: Number of neurons equal to the number of layers in the base-learner
    - Hidden Layer: 32 units, ReLU activation
    - Output Layer: Number of neurons equal to the number of layers in the base-learner

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Convergence Speed**:
  - Number of epochs to reach a specified accuracy threshold (e.g., 90% for CIFAR-10 and MNIST; 85% for IMDB).
  
- **Final Accuracy**:
  - Accuracy on the test set after the completion of training.

- **Loss Reduction**:
  - Rate of decrease in training and validation loss over epochs.
  
- **Stability of Training**:
  - Variance in the training and validation accuracy over epochs to assess the stability introduced by adaptive learning rates.

By following this experiment plan, we aim to rigorously test the efficacy of adaptive learning rate adjustment via meta-learning and determine its impact on the training performance of neural networks across different tasks and datasets.
