# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization through M

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization through Meta-Learning:**

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of using meta-learning techniques to adaptively optimize the learning rate in neural network training processes. The goal is to determine if a meta-learned learning rate schedule can outperform traditional fixed or manually scheduled learning rates in terms of model performance and training efficiency.

### 2. Methodology

1. **Meta-Learning Framework:**
   Develop a meta-learning framework where an outer optimization loop learns an optimal learning rate schedule for an inner neural network training loop. The outer loop will use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict learning rates based on the inner loop’s training metrics.

2. **Inner Loop Training:**
   Train a neural network model on a standard supervised learning task (e.g., image classification or natural language processing).

3. **Outer Loop Optimization:**
   Use an RNN to adjust the learning rate dynamically based on feedback from the inner loop’s performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).

4. **Comparison Baselines:**
   Compare the meta-learned adaptive learning rate with traditional learning rate schedules such as:
   - Fixed learning rate
   - Step decay
   - Exponential decay
   - Cyclical learning rates

5. **Training Procedure:**
   - Initialize the inner model with random weights.
   - Train the inner model using the current learning rate from the outer RNN.
   - After each epoch, update the learning rate using the meta-learning RNN based on performance metrics.
   - Iterate the process for a fixed number of epochs or until convergence.

### 3. Datasets

1. **Image Classification:**
   - **CIFAR-10** (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `cifar10`)
   - **MNIST** (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `mnist`)

2. **Natural Language Processing:**
   - **AG News** (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `ag_news`)
   - **IMDB Sentiment Analysis** (available on Hugging Face Datasets: `imdb`)

### 4. Model Architecture

1. **Image Classification:**
   - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
     - Example: Simple CNN with Conv layers, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.

2. **Natural Language Processing:**
   - **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**
     - Example: LSTM-based text classifier with Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers.

3. **Meta-Learning RNN:**
   - **RNN Architecture:**
     - LSTM or GRU with a few layers and units to predict the learning rate.

- **Loss:** Track the loss value (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification tasks).
- **Training Time:** Measure the total time taken to train the model until convergence.
- **Learning Rate Dynamics:** Analyze the learning rate values over epochs to understand the adaptation behavior.
- **Generalization Error:** Evaluate the difference between training and validation/test performance to assess overfitting.

### Execution Plan

   - Prepare the computational environment with necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

2. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implement the inner model architectures and the meta-learning RNN.

3. **Data Preparation:**

6. **Analysis:**
