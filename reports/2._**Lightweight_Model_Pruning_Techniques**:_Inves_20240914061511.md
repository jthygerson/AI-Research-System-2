# Experiment Report: 2. **Lightweight Model Pruning Techniques**: Inves

## Idea

The focus would be on reducing model size and inference time without significant loss in accuracy, enabling faster deployment and execution on limited hardware.

## Experiment Plan
## Experiment Plan: Lightweight Model Pruning Techniques

### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to investigate computationally efficient model pruning techniques that can be implemented during the training process. The goal is to reduce model size and inference time without significant loss in accuracy, thereby enabling faster deployment and execution on limited hardware. The experiment will compare several novel pruning techniques against standard pruning methods to evaluate their effectiveness.

### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Model Training**:
   - Train a baseline model on a given dataset to establish a performance benchmark.
   
2. **Pruning Techniques**:
   - Implement several lightweight pruning techniques, such as:
     - **Layer-wise Pruning**: Prune less important neurons from each layer based on their contribution to the loss.
     - **Gradient-based Pruning**: Use the gradient information during training to prune weights that have minimal impact on the loss.
     - **Dynamic Pruning**: Continuously prune weights during training based on a predefined schedule.
     - **Lottery Ticket Hypothesis**: Train smaller subnetworks that can match the performance of the original network when trained from scratch.
   
3. **Pruning During Training**:
   - Integrate the pruning techniques into the training loop.
   - Regularly prune the model at specified intervals during training.
   
4. **Model Fine-tuning**:
   - Fine-tune the pruned models to recover any potential loss in accuracy.
   
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare the pruned models against the baseline model in terms of model size, inference time, and accuracy.

### 3. Datasets
The following datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets will be used:
   - **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (`"cifar10"`)
   - **Natural Language Processing**: SST-2 (`"glue", subset="sst2"`)
   - **Speech Recognition**: LibriSpeech ASR (`"librispeech_asr"`)
   
### 4. Model Architecture
The following model types will be used for the experiment:
   - **Image Classification**: ResNet-50
   - **Natural Language Processing**: BERT Base
   - **Speech Recognition**: Wav2Vec2 Base
   
### 5. Hyperparameters
The key hyperparameters for training and pruning are:

- **General Training Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning Rate: `0.001`
  - Batch Size: `32`
  - Epochs: `50`
  - Optimizer: `Adam`

- **Pruning Hyperparameters**:
  - Pruning Frequency: `every 5 epochs`
  - Pruning Percentage per Iteration: `10%`
  - Pruning Criterion: `L1 norm`, `Gradient magnitude`
  - Fine-tuning Learning Rate: `0.0001`
  - Fine-tuning Epochs: `10`

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics will be used to evaluate the performance of the models:

- **Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy (for classification tasks)
  - Word Error Rate (for speech recognition)
  
- **Efficiency Metrics**:
  - Model Size (number of parameters)
  - Inference Time (milliseconds per inference)
  
- **Effectiveness of Pruning**:
  - Reduction in Model Size (%) compared to the baseline
  - Reduction in Inference Time (%) compared to the baseline
  - Change in Accuracy (%) compared to the baseline

By systematically implementing and evaluating these pruning techniques, the experiment aims to identify methods that achieve a good balance between model performance and computational efficiency.
