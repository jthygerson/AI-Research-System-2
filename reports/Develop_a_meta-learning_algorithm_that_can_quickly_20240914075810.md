# Experiment Report: Develop a meta-learning algorithm that can quickly

## Idea
Develop a meta-learning algorithm that can quickly predict optimal hyperparameters for different types of neural networks based on past training runs. This method would use a single GPU to train a meta-model that learns from previous training data, reducing the time and computational resources needed for hyperparameter tuning in new projects.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that can predict optimal hyperparameters for different types of neural networks. This approach aims to reduce the time and computational resources needed for hyperparameter tuning by leveraging a meta-model trained on past training runs. The hypothesis is that the meta-learning model will provide hyperparameter recommendations that yield comparable or better performance than traditional hyperparameter optimization methods.

### 2. Methodology
The experiment will involve the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset containing information about past training runs, including hyperparameters and corresponding performance metrics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for training the meta-model.
3. **Meta-Model Training**: Train a meta-learning model on the preprocessed dataset using a single GPU.
4. **Hyperparameter Prediction**: Use the trained meta-model to predict optimal hyperparameters for new neural network training tasks.
5. **Evaluation**: Compare the performance of neural networks trained with meta-model recommended hyperparameters against those trained with traditional hyperparameter optimization methods.

### 3. Datasets
Datasets used for this experiment will be sourced from Hugging Face Datasets:
- **OpenML**: A collection of datasets containing various machine learning benchmarks.
- **ModelNet**: Contains metadata about training runs, including hyperparameters and performance metrics.
- **HyperparameterHunter**: A dataset specifically focused on hyperparameter optimization experiments.

### 4. Model Architecture
- **Meta-Model**: A neural network designed to predict hyperparameters. This will be a regression model with the following architecture:
  - Input Layer: Features representing past training runs (e.g., model type, dataset characteristics, previous hyperparameters).
  - Dense Layers: Multiple fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
  - Output Layer: Linear layer predicting the optimal hyperparameters.

- **Target Models**: Various neural network architectures to evaluate the predicted hyperparameters:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  - Transformers

### 5. Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters to be predicted by the meta-model include:
- **Learning Rate**: Continuous value, typically in the range [1e-5, 1e-1].
- **Batch Size**: Discrete values, e.g., [16, 32, 64, 128].
- **Number of Layers**: Discrete values, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5].
- **Dropout Rate**: Continuous value, typically in the range [0.1, 0.5].

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the meta-learning algorithm will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: The difference between the predicted and actual optimal hyperparameters.
- **Training Time Reduction**: Comparison of the time taken to reach optimal performance using predicted hyperparameters versus traditional methods.
- **Model Performance**: Evaluation of the target model's performance using the predicted hyperparameters, measured by:
  - **Accuracy**: For classification tasks.
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression tasks.
  - **F1 Score**: For tasks with imbalanced classes.
- **Computational Efficiency**: GPU utilization and energy consumption during hyperparameter tuning.

### Summary
This experiment aims to develop and validate a meta-learning model that predicts optimal hyperparameters for neural networks based on past training data. By reducing the time and computational resources required for hyperparameter tuning, this approach seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of AI research and development.
