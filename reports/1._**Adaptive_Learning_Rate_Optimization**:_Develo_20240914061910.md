# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develo

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization**: Develop an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts based on the complexity of the data being processed. This scheduler would use real-time feedback from the training metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) to fine-tune the learning rate, thereby speeding up convergence without requiring manual tuning.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Optimization

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive learning rate scheduler that dynamically adjusts based on the complexity of the data being processed. The aim is to determine whether the adaptive scheduler can improve convergence speed and model performance compared to static and traditional learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Implement the adaptive learning rate scheduler.
   - Define baseline learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, exponential decay) for comparison.
   
2. **Experiment Design**:
   - Train models using both the adaptive learning rate scheduler and baseline schedulers.
   - Collect training metrics such as loss and accuracy at each epoch.
   - Compare convergence speeds and final performance metrics.

3. **Adaptive Scheduler Implementation**:
   - The adaptive scheduler will monitor training loss and accuracy.
   - It will adjust the learning rate dynamically based on changes in these metrics.
   - If the loss plateaus or reduces very slowly, the learning rate will be increased.
   - If the loss increases, the learning rate will be decreased.

4. **Training Procedure**:
   - Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train each model for a fixed number of epochs, ensuring consistent training conditions.
   - Validate the model after each epoch to provide feedback for the adaptive scheduler.

5. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform statistical tests to determine if observed differences in performance are significant.
   - Use visualization tools to plot learning curves and compare the performance of different schedulers.

#### 3. Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A widely-used dataset for image classification tasks containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 50,000 movie reviews.
- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 70,000 grayscale images in 10 classes.
