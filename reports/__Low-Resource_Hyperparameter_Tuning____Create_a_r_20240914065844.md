# Experiment Report: **Low-Resource Hyperparameter Tuning:** Create a r

## Idea
**Low-Resource Hyperparameter Tuning:** Create a resource-efficient hyperparameter tuning framework that employs Bayesian optimization but is specifically designed to be computationally efficient on a single GPU. This system would use a reduced set of trials and incorporate early stopping criteria to conserve resources while still finding near-optimal hyperparameters.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the performance and resource efficiency of a low-resource hyperparameter tuning framework that employs Bayesian optimization. This framework aims to find near-optimal hyperparameters for machine learning models while minimizing computational resources, particularly focusing on a single GPU setup. The experiment will compare the proposed framework against traditional hyperparameter tuning methods in terms of both performance metrics and resource consumption.

### 2. Methodology
- **Baseline Setup**: Establish a baseline using traditional hyperparameter tuning methods such as grid search and random search.
- **Proposed Framework**: Implement the low-resource hyperparameter tuning framework using Bayesian optimization with specific features like a reduced set of trials and early stopping criteria.
- **Comparison**: Run experiments using both the baseline and the proposed framework on identical datasets and model architectures.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track GPU utilization, computational time, and memory consumption for each method.
- **Performance Measurement**: Evaluate the model performance using standard evaluation metrics.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess datasets.
2. **Model Initialization**: Initialize models with predefined architectures.
3. **Baseline Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning using traditional methods.
4. **Framework Tuning**: Apply the proposed low-resource tuning framework.
5. **Evaluation**: Compare the results in terms of model performance and resource usage.

- **CIFAR-10**: For image classification tasks.
- **UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**: For binary classification tasks.
- **Hugging Face Datasets**: Use the `datasets` library to load and preprocess data.

class ModelWithDropout(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super(ModelWithDropout, self).__init__()
        self.model = OriginalModel(config)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.5)  # Applying dropout with a probability of 0.5

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.model(x)
        x = self.dropout(x)
        return x

model = ModelWithDropout(config)
