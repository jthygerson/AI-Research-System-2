# Experiment Report: 4. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Im

## Idea
4. **Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement a meta-learning framework that automates the hyperparameter tuning process by learning from previous tuning tasks. The goal is to achieve near-optimal hyperparameter settings quickly and with fewer computational resources by leveraging transfer learning and past experience.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Meta-Learning for Hyperparameter Tuning

#### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a meta-learning framework in automating the hyperparameter tuning process. Specifically, we aim to:
- Reduce the time and computational resources required for hyperparameter tuning.
- Achieve near-optimal hyperparameter settings by leveraging knowledge from past tuning tasks.
- Compare the performance of the meta-learning approach against traditional hyperparameter tuning methods like Grid Search and Random Search.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Meta-Learning Framework**: Implement a meta-learning framework that uses a repository of past hyperparameter tuning results. This framework will employ transfer learning to generalize across different tuning tasks and make predictions for new hyperparameter settings.
- **Base Learner**: Choose a base model (e.g., a neural network, SVM, or decision tree) for which hyperparameter tuning will be performed.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use techniques such as MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) or Reptile to transfer knowledge from past tasks to new tasks.
- **Comparison**: Conduct experiments using Grid Search and Random Search as baselines for comparison.

#### 3. Datasets
- **Text Classification**: IMDB Reviews Dataset (from Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Image Classification**: CIFAR-10 (from Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Tabular Data**: Titanic Dataset (from Kaggle, can be downloaded and uploaded to Hugging Face Datasets)
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Electricity Consumption Dataset (from Hugging Face Datasets)

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Text Classification**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Image Classification**: ResNet-50
- **Tabular Data**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Time Series Forecasting**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

#### 5. Hyperparameters

  - batch_size: [16, 32, 64]
  - epochs: [3, 4, 5]
- **ResNet-50**:
  - learning_rate: [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]
  - batch_size: [32, 64, 128]
  - epochs: [10, 20, 30]
- **Random Forest Classifier**:
  - n_estimators: [100, 200, 300]

  - batch_size: [16, 32, 64]
  - epochs: [20, 50, 100]

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
- **Text Classification**:
  - Accuracy
  - F1 Score
- **Image Classification**:
  - Accuracy
  - Top-1 and Top-5 Accuracy
- **Tabular Data**:
  - Accuracy
  - AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)

  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Additional Metrics for Comparison**:
- **Time to Convergence**: Measure the time taken to achieve near-optimal hyperparameters.
- **Computational Resources Used**: Track the number of CPU/GPU hours consumed during the tuning process.
