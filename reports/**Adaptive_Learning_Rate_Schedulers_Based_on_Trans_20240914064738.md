# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Trans

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Transfer Learning**: Develop a lightweight algorithm that uses pre-trained models to dynamically adjust learning rates for new tasks. The scheduler can leverage knowledge from similar tasks to set more effective learning rates, potentially accelerating convergence and improving performance with minimal computational overhead.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Testing Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers Based on Transfer Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive learning rate schedulers that leverage pre-trained models for dynamically adjusting learning rates in new tasks. We aim to determine if these adaptive schedulers can accelerate convergence and improve performance with minimal computational overhead compared to traditional static or manually-tuned learning rate schedules.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Step 1: Pre-training Phase** 
  - Use a set of source tasks to pre-train models and collect learning rate schedules and performance metrics.
- **Step 2: Transfer Learning Phase**
  - Develop a lightweight algorithm that analyzes pre-trained models to determine suitable learning rates for new tasks.
- **Step 3: Target Task Training**
  - Apply the adaptive learning rate scheduler to train models on target tasks.
- **Step 4: Comparative Analysis**
  - Compare the performance and convergence rate of models trained with adaptive learning rate schedulers against those using static and manually-tuned learning rates.

#### 3. Datasets
Utilize datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets for both the pre-training and target tasks.

- **Source Tasks (Pre-training Phase)**
  - GLUE Benchmark (General Language Understanding Evaluation)
    - Dataset: `glue`
    - Subsets: `SST-2`, `MNLI`, `QQP`, `QNLI`, `CoLA`, `RTE`, `MRPC`
- **Target Tasks (Transfer Learning Phase)**
  - IMDB Sentiment Analysis
    - Dataset: `imdb`
  - AG News Classification
    - Dataset: `ag_news`
  - SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
    - Dataset: `squad`

#### 4. Model Architecture
- **Pre-trained Models**
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
  - RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)
- **Target Task Models**
  - Fine-tuned versions of the pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa models specific to each target task.

#### 5. Hyperparameters
For each training phase, we will use the following key hyperparameters:

- **Static Learning Rate**: `2e-5`
- **Batch Size**: `32`
- **Epochs**: `3`
- **Warmup Steps**: `500`
- **Weight Decay**: `0.01`
- **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler Parameters**:
  - **Initial Learning Rate**: `2e-5`
  - **Decay Factor**: `0.1`
  - **Lookahead Steps**: `100`
  - **Threshold Improvement**: `1%`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
We will evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive learning rate scheduler using the following metrics:

- **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs to reach 95% of the best final performance.
- **Final Performance**:
  - **Accuracy**: For classification tasks like IMDB and AG News.
  - **F1 Score**: For classification tasks with imbalanced classes.
  - **Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score**: For the SQuAD dataset.
- **Computational Overhead**: Additional computational cost introduced by the adaptive scheduler compared to static and manually-tuned learning rates.
- **Stability**: Variance in performance across multiple runs with different random seeds.

### Execution Plan
1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and split the datasets into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model Pre-training**: Pre-train BERT and RoBERTa models on the GLUE benchmark datasets.
3. **Algorithm Development**: Implement the adaptive learning rate scheduler.
4. **Transfer Learning**: Apply the adaptive scheduler to fine-tune models on target tasks (IMDB, AG News, SQuAD).
5. **Training and Evaluation**: Train the models using both the adaptive scheduler and traditional methods, then evaluate based on the defined metrics.
6. **Analysis and Reporting**: Analyze the results, compare performance, and document findings.

By following this plan, we aim to rigorously test the hypothesis that adaptive learning rate schedulers based on transfer learning can provide significant improvements in training efficiency and model performance.
