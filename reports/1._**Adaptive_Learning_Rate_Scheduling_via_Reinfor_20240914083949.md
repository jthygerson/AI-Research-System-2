# Experiment Report: 1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Reinfor

## Idea
1. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling via Reinforcement Learning**: Design a reinforcement learning-based approach to dynamically adjust the learning rate of neural networks during training. The RL agent can be trained to observe the performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) and make real-time adjustments to the learning rate, optimizing it for faster convergence and better final performance.

## Experiment Plan
### 1. Objective
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of an Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training neural networks. We aim to determine whether this RL-based approach can lead to faster convergence and improved final performance compared to traditional learning rate schedules.

### 2. Methodology
#### 2.1 Experimental Design
The experiment will be divided into two phases:
1. **Training Phase**: Train an RL agent to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on real-time performance metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) during the training of a neural network.
2. **Evaluation Phase**: Compare the performance of the RL-adaptive learning rate scheduler against traditional learning rate schedules (e.g., constant, step decay, exponential decay) on a set of benchmark datasets.

#### 2.2 RL Agent Training
- **State Representation**: The state will include current performance metrics like loss, accuracy, epoch number, and current learning rate.
- **Action Space**: Actions will be discrete changes to the learning rate (e.g., increase by 10%, decrease by 10%, keep unchanged).
- **Reward Function**: The reward will be based on the improvement in performance metrics. For example, a decrease in loss or an increase in accuracy will provide positive rewards.
- **RL Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) will be used for training the RL agent due to its robustness and ease of tuning.

#### 2.3 Training Procedure
1. Initialize the neural network model and the RL agent.
2. For each epoch:
   - Feed the current state to the RL agent.
   - Obtain the action and adjust the learning rate accordingly.
   - Train the model for one epoch with the adjusted learning rate.
   - Update the state and reward based on the performance.
   - Train the RL agent with the new state-reward pairs.

### 3. Datasets
We will use the following benchmark datasets available on Hugging Face Datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. **IMDB**: A dataset for binary sentiment classification containing 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.

### 4. Model Architecture
We will use different model architectures suitable for the datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: ResNet-18
2. **MNIST**: Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with two convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers.
3. **IMDB**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for text classification.

### 5. Hyperparameters
The initial hyperparameters for training the models and RL agent are as follows:
- **Learning Rate**: Initial learning rate = 0.01
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **RL Agent Hyperparameters**:
  - Gamma: 0.99
  - Learning Rate: 0.0003
  - PPO Clip Range: 0.2
  - PPO Update Frequency: 5 epochs

### 6. Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the RL-based adaptive learning rate scheduler, we will use the following metrics:
1. **Training Time**: Total time taken to complete training.
2. **Final Accuracy**: Accuracy on the test dataset after training is complete.
3. **Final Loss**: Loss on the test dataset after training is complete.
4. **Convergence Speed**: Number of epochs required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold.

### Conclusion
This experiment aims to determine the viability of using an RL-based approach for dynamically adjusting learning rates during the training of neural networks. By comparing the performance metrics of the RL-adaptive scheduler against traditional methods, we can assess its effectiveness in improving training efficiency and final model performance.
