# Experiment Report: **Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers with Meta-Lear

## Idea
**Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers with Meta-Learning:** Develop a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate scheduler based on the loss landscape during training. This approach could leverage past training runs to predict optimal learning rate schedules, thereby improving convergence rates and final model performance with minimal overhead.

## Experiment Plan
### Experiment Plan: Adaptive Learning Rate Schedulers with Meta-Learning

#### 1. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to develop and evaluate a meta-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the learning rate scheduler based on the loss landscape during training. This approach aims to leverage past training runs to predict optimal learning rate schedules, with the goal of improving convergence rates and final model performance while minimizing computational overhead.

#### 2. Methodology
**a. Meta-Learning Algorithm Development:**
   - Develop a meta-learning algorithm using a recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM) network to predict the optimal learning rate schedule.
   - Input features for the meta-learner will include training loss, gradients, and other relevant statistics (e.g., second-order derivatives, momentum terms).
   - The meta-learner will be trained on a collection of past training runs across various datasets and model architectures.

**b. Training Procedure:**
   - Implement the meta-learning algorithm in a commonly used deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).
   - Train the meta-learner using a diverse set of models and datasets to ensure generalizability.

**c. Implementation of Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduler:**
   - Integrate the trained meta-learner into the training loop of new models.
   - Compare the performance of models trained with the adaptive learning rate scheduler against those trained with standard learning rate schedulers (e.g., StepLR, ExponentialLR, and Cosine Annealing).

**d. Experimental Setup:**
   - Conduct experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures to validate the effectiveness of the adaptive learning rate scheduler.
   - Perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of different features used by the meta-learner.

#### 3. Datasets
Datasets will be selected to cover a variety of domains and tasks, available on Hugging Face Datasets:
   - **Image Classification:** CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
   - **Natural Language Processing:** GLUE Benchmark (General Language Understanding Evaluation)
   - **Time Series Forecasting:** M4 Dataset
   - **Speech Recognition:** LibriSpeech ASR Corpus

#### 4. Model Architecture
A diverse set of model architectures will be used to ensure the generalizability of the adaptive learning rate scheduler:
   - **Image Classification:** ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0
   - **Natural Language Processing:** BERT (Base), GPT-2 (Small)
   - **Time Series Forecasting:** LSTM, Transformer
   - **Speech Recognition:** DeepSpeech, Wav2Vec 2.0

#### 5. Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters to be tuned and evaluated:
   - **Base Learning Rate:** `1e-4`, `1e-3`, `1e-2`
   - **Batch Size:** `32`, `64`, `128`
   - **Optimizer:** `Adam`, `SGD`
   - **Meta-Learner Architecture:** `RNN`, `LSTM`, `Transformer`
   - **Meta-Learner Learning Rate:** `1e-4`, `1e-3`
   - **Meta-Learner Hidden Units:** `128`, `256`, `512`
   - **Training Epochs:** `50`, `100`

#### 6. Evaluation Metrics
Performance will be evaluated using the following metrics, specific to each task:
   - **Image Classification:** Accuracy, Top-5 Accuracy
   - **Natural Language Processing:** F1 Score, Accuracy (for classification tasks)
   - **Time Series Forecasting:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - **Speech Recognition:** Word Error Rate (WER)

Additionally, meta-learner effectiveness will be evaluated using:
   - **Convergence Rate:** Number of epochs to reach a specified performance threshold.
   - **Final Performance:** Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, MAE, WER) at the end of training.
   - **Computational Overhead:** Time and computational resources required to train with the adaptive learning rate scheduler compared to standard schedulers.

This experiment plan aims to rigorously validate the proposed adaptive learning rate scheduler with meta-learning, ensuring comprehensive evaluation across multiple domains, datasets, and model architectures.
